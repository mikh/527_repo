|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |    |
|  c  |  O( [log(V)] ^ 2) + O(log(V))  |
|  d  |    |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
For each iteration, we are inserting (takes O(log(n)) time) and, starting after the each number is added once, adding to a list (takes O(1)) time. This is completed log(n) times: so we have, O(log(n)) * [O(log(n)) + O(1)] = O( [log(n)] ^ 2) + O(log(n)).

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm always produces a minimum spanning tree, as it deletes the edges with the highest weight as long as doing so will not create a disconnected graph. This running time is O(E*log(V)).
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>

      ---|-5-
      \  |  /
   1   \ | /  1 
        \|/  

Here, the algorithm can give us a minimum spanning tree whose total weight is 1+5+2 = 8 if it chooses randomly to iterate through the vertex with weight 5. However, the actual minimum spanning tree has total weight 1+1+2 = 4.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm produces a minimum spanning tree. Its running time is O(E*[log(V)]^2).
</VERBATIM>

---++!! Grader comments *[16/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
