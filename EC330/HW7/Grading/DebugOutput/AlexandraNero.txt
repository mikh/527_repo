Does this graph exhibit the triangle inequality? 
Yes, physically driving from point A to point B is always shorter than going to point A to point C to point B. 
Google maps always strives to give an optimal route.

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Describe your algorithm here. Pseudocode is preferred.

functionPrims(graph G, int V){

Q = G.v //Q is a linked list with all the vertices
Vertex v1 = Q.v[0] //grab the first vertex
tree = NULL

while (Q.size != 0){
for all edges connected to v1:
list smallest.add(edge)

int i = 0
vertex v2 - smallest[0]
while (v2 in Q){
i++
Vertex v2 = smallest[i] //gets the vertex the smallest edges is connected to, if we have already seen this vertex than go to another vertex
}

Q.delete(v2);
tree.add(v2)
v1 = v2
}
return Q
}


</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Descrbie and analyze your algorithm.
Explanation:
	-Builds tree one edge at a time by choosing smallest-weight edges
	-Pick a starting vertex
	-Among the edges connecting the vertex in the tree and one outside, choose the one with the smallest weight
	-Repeat step previous step until all vertices have been added

Time is V^2 + E: first it starts as V for going through each of the vertices in a bigger loop, and then V time for looking through each of the adjacent vertices in an inner loop
E time comes 2E total in the code: 1E from seeing if the current vertex is in the linked list and another E for checking which E of V is the smallest edge.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
O(E(E+V))
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
A counter example could be any graph
| Edge | Vertex 1 | Vertex 2 | Weight |
| 0 | 0 | 2 | 5 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 2 | 0 | 3 | 12 |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | 30 | 
| 4 | 1 | 3 | 5 |


if the algorithm chooses a vertex arbitrarily, let's say it starts at the 0 vertex and grabs an edge with a weight of 5 going to 2 vertex, 
then at 2 vertex it goes to 3 and picks up an edge of weight 4. Then at 3 it goes to 0 and picks up an edge with weight 12, not looking at the possible smaller weight edges that could have been added.
Parts a and c produce a tree because there is a correctly place step in the process where the edges are compared to each other.

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the algorithm.

keep in mind: for the length of an entire quote or phrase to unscramble = L ex. World_Wide_Web's length = 14
length of the nodes is L - 4 or 10 (size of the array of nodes)

The algorithm is dependent of the class Node which describes the vertex of the graph that will be created. Each vertex has an id and  a prev and next pointer saying where in the graph it will go.
first the strings are preprocessed: put into an array and forwarded to the print string function can take up to L time)
each of the strings are created as Nodes which are added in an array((L-4) time). Then each node is compared to every other node((L-4)^2), checking to see if the suffix of the current node = the prefix of the comparison node, if so, then the next and prev variables of the two nodes are changed to pint at each other.
Once the graph is completed, the starting point is found by looking at all the prev integers of the nodes(L-4), the one without a prev, i.e. it does not point to a node that should precede it, it must be the head and we should start there.
Then the string is outputted by following the Nodes(L-4) and the next indexes in the node array. it prints out the first letter of each id in the node, then prints out the whole string for the last node. 

the total time is 3(L-4) + (L-4)^2 + L
or O(n^2)

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the modification

CODE FOR 4B AND 4C HAS BEEN ATTACHED AND COMMENTED
for the reads of different length, this does not affect my code, I only care about the suffixes and prefixes of lengths 5, 4, or 3 being matched to other pieces of the text in order to create a graph that connects all of them.  
LOOK TO 4C FOR TIME COMPLEXITY

</VERBATIM>

---++ 4c.  More complications [5 points]
---+++!! i and ii
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the modification.
THIS APPLIES TO PARTS I AND II

TIME COMPLEXITY, Where matches is the number of possible prefix and suffix matches, M (worst case each string match to every other string and is equal to L-1)
see 4a for the orginal complexity
= O(n^2), more specifically 3(L-4) + 3((L-4)^2) + L*M

This part inspired more modification of my code.
For the main function, printString, I knew that piece will match up to more than one other piece. I therefore now keep the references to the indices of the matching pieces in vectors call prev and next.
Also, if a node has no other matches, it may be because it is the end node, or because there are missing sub strings or errors causing it to not match. I therefore lower the requirements and try a couple more times. I do not do much for the case of duplicates because there may be naturally occurring duplicates I wish to take into consideration.(T(3L^2))
After getting all the prev and next matches I attempt to find the beginning of the code. I start by counting how many prev matches I have, figuring that like 4a my head node will have the least chance of having a node that points to it.
For printing, I add in another check where I try not to visit the same node twice. (T(M)) Once I visit the node I erase their value in a temp vector of the nodes. Any node with an erased value I have not visit and therefore I should try another node that is included in the next vector.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

<VERBATIM>
CODE DOES NOT WORK, ONLY THE FIRST 70 CITIES OF THE CYCLE ARE FOUND
CONSIDER THE CODE FOR PARTIAL CREDIT

First the file is read, the cities are taken in and edges are made between cities. 
This creates a connected graph. It uses Classes City and Edge as the Vertex 
and the Edges of the graph respectively. Once the graph is initialized, then a 
minimum spanning tree is found. To fully connect the tree in order to create a 
cycle, the last city's edges are analyzed. If it can connect to the first city, then 
that is chosen. If not, the code goes through the vertices and sees if there is a 
vertices or a series of connected vertices that will take the final city to the first 
city. Of course, the weight is taken into account, and the minimum is found.

However, there is an error in the code where a city's EdgeVect is getting extremely high.
Could not solve in time

</VERBATIM>

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
