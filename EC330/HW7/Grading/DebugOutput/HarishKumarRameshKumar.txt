Does this graph exhibit the triangle inequality? 
Yes it does, all triangle do follow the A<=B+C theory wherein A,B,C are all the sides of the triangle.

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
void Kruskal(Graph &g){
A=empty set;
for each in g.vertex
  create disjoint_set(v)
/sort edges in G in ascending order;
/consider each edge:
for (each v1,v2 of one edge)
  if  find(v1)!=find(v2)
       then add these vertices to A
       and unite them (unite(v1,v2)
return A;

}
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Kruskal's Algorithm could be used to efficiently fine the minimum spanning tree.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm does produce a minimum spanning tree. The run time would look like : O(E*lg(E)) = O(E*lg(V)). However using DFS would increase the run time to : O(E*log(V) + E(E+V)) = O(E^2 + E(V)).
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm produces a spanning tree but not necessarily a minimum spanning tree. As the edges are taken in arbitrary order, this would fail for any tree who has an edge list that was not sorted, since the checking done by this algorithm is only to check for the lack of cycles. It does not necessarily check for minimum paths in a spanning tree. 
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm does produce a minimum spanning tree. Line 3 = O(1), line 4, 5, 6 can be done in O(V) time. The for loop goes through the entire adjacency list and hence has a run time of O(E). The total run time for this algorithm is O(V*E) time.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
