|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O(nlog(n)*log(nlogn)) = O(n log(n) (log(n)+log(log(n))))  |

---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide explanation for partial credits
</VERBATIM>

Because of the  condition: "insert log(n) copies each (in turn) of the numbers 1 through n. For example, if n = 1010, then there we will be inserting ten 1's followed by ten 2's followed by ten 3's, etc.", instead of normally the time it takes to insert a single constant value which would result in: <br>
b) O(nlog(n) <br>
c) O(n) <br>
d) O(n^2) <br>
The constant insertion takes on the form of nlogn time instead, substituting the n's for nlogn time <br>

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Describe your algorithm here. Pseudocode is preferred.
</VERBATIM>

Prim's algorithm: <br>
Start at a node and continuously pick the smallest weighted edge connected to that node that does not form a cycle.

%CODE{"cpp"}%
    Q = all vertices;
    key[v] = infinity; 
    key[root] = 0;
    while Q != 0;
        u = extract-min(Q);
        for each v adj to u;
            if V exists in Q and (u,v) < key[v];
                key[v] = w(u,v);
                pi[v] = u;

Descrbie and analyze your algorithm.

Suming the parts: V, VlogV, E, ElogV, V, leads to O((E+V)logV) but simplified to answer below w/ binary heap. <br>
With a binary heap O(E*log(V)) runtime. <br>

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

Adjacency list representation for T. Using Merge sort --> O(E*log(E)) <br>
Check if connected graph with BFS or DFS in O(V + E) time. <br>
Lastly BFS or DFS is performed E times, once for each edge. <br>

total: O(E*log(E) + E*(V + E)) <br>
O(E^2) longest component. <br>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

Counterexample: <br> 
Graph: A--B--C   <br>
Weights: A--B = 1,  B--C =2,  A--C = 3    (undirected edges) <br>

MST would have to include A--B & B--C resulting in a final weight of 3. But with this algorithms edges are selected arbitrarily until a cycle is formed so... <br>
A--C & B--C could be selected first and then when A--B is selected that forms a cycle so that edge is rejected but the result would then be weight 5!, which is not the MST of this graph. <br>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

Using adjacency list for T: <br>
Add edge to T takes: O(1) <br>
Checking for cycle (Using DFS because no more then 1 cycle will ever occur): Thus resulting in DFS O(V+E) goes too --> O(V) <br>
Finding maximim weighted edge: O(V) <br>
Deleting an edge: O(V) <br>
We operate on every edge: O(E) <br>

Cumulatively for each edge we add onto T, do DFS, and possible find cycle necessary for deletion: <br>
total runtime: O(VE) <br>

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the algorithm.
</VERBATIM>

First read the file delimited by '[' into a vector list of strings. <br>
Determine the first entry with a capital letter & then loop twice through the length of the vector of strings, each time comparing the last 4 substring of the final string with the first 4 entries of the list indexed vector. O(Vec.size^2) time <br>

This double for loop operates in O(Vec.size^2) time with other components all taking less time individually. <br>
total runtime: O(4*Vec.size^2) which is = O(Vec.size^2) because of const length substrings.

Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits.

Describe and analyze the modification
</VERBATIM>

if (myvec[j].substr(0,4) == final.substr(final.size()-4,final.size())) { <br>

would have to be modified to: <br>

if (myvec[j].substr(0,myvec[j].size()-1) == final.substr(final.size()-myvec[j].size()-1,final.size())) {  <br>

In essence the comparison step step instead of comparing the first 4 to the last 4 of the new substring needs to be changed to the length of the substring being compared -1, to the substring at the end of the final string with substring-1 size of characters to compare. <br>
total runtime: O(Vec.size^2) time is approximately right if substrings are still small constants, but if substrings are long then O(average(substring.length)*Vec.size^2) is more accurate <br>

The issue of replication may be solved by introducing a memory aspect to the program so that when recurrent patterns occur they are ignored, this will add substantial computational time however but it is a possiblity. <br>
In the case of missing substrings, this may be remedied by continuing the searching chain even if no perfect match for  a substring was found & instead sat 3/4 match perfectly if this is the best case, so in essence introducing a memory of best match up to data for the iterations. <br>

</VERBATIM>

Reads containing random errors can be accounted for by introducing a type of weighting, for instance perfect string matches will be weighted higher then 5/6 matches which are higher then 4/6, etc... <br>
These weights may then be analyzed in order to determine which matches would suit the string match next & the final string will be the one with the highest matching weights. <br>
Knowing that errors often occur at the ends may also hint at focusing this approach towards the ends of the string. <br>

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found. <br>

The approach goes as to be stated: <br>
- First select a root node. <br>
- Second construct a MST using Prim's algorithm <br>
- Third list the vertices visited in pre-order walk of the constructed MST & lastly add the root node at the end to finish the eularian cycle <br>
Pseudocode is attached in zip.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
