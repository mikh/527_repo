---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |   n^2log(n)log(log (n))   |
|  c  |  n^2log(n)   |
|  d  |  n^2(log(n))^2   |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
Number of insertions: n*log(n)


b. Worst case insertion is from 1 to n. Inserting the same number produces a vaguely balanced tree. Total height of the tree is n log log n.

c. Inserting in worst case order, for completely unbalanced tree, numbers from 1 to n results in a height of n for the BST. 
Inserting additional numbers to the front of a list will take O(1) time. 
Inserting additional nodes of higher values in the tree will take O(n) time.

d. Worst case pick the same side for every single insertion, for a tree of height nlog(n).

The thing is that these distances are not a straight line due to the roads.
In addition, rounding the hours can mess up the triangles.
But the triangle inequality still exists given these potential issues.

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm

KRUSKAL(G):
 A = NULL;
 for each v in G.V:
    MAKE-SET(v)
 foreach (u, v) ordered by weight(u, v), increasing:
    if FIND-SET(u) not equal FIND-SET(v):
       A = A union {(u, v)}
       UNION(u, v)
 return A

</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Prim's algorithm is found to run faster in dense graphs with more number of edges than vertices, 
whereas Kruskal's algorithm is found to run faster in sparse graphs.
It does depend on the circumstances of the graph give, but since one of the parameters
is that the weight is less than 100, one could say that's not too dense.
Therefore, Kruskal's approach could work in this scenario.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
T is a MST. This algorithm is the opposite to the Kruskal's algorithm. 
We assume to separate G into two parts: V1 and V2, then Kruskal's algorithm is based on the fact that the smallest weight edge connecting V1 and V2 must be in T. 
The Kruskal's algorithm is to find that smallest edge and put it into T, 
and now this algorithm is to delete those edges which are not smallest and until only the smallest one is left. 
So actually they are equivalent. Both of them use the Bridge property. Thus T is a MST.
Sorting the edges takes &#920;(ElogE); We use DFS or BFS to check the connection which takes &#920;(E+V); 
Since we have E edges, so in total it will be &#920;(ElogE+E(E+V))=&#920;(E^2). 
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
T is not a MST. Arbitrarily selecting edges has no way to guarantee the minimum weight.
The most efficient way to do this problem is using the disjoint set data structure. 
For disjoint set data structure, the optimal way is to use disjoint set forest with both "union by rank" and "path compression", 
in which we will have V make-set, E find-set, and V union-set. So the total running time is O((E+V)alpha(V)), alpha() is the inverse Ackermann function.
Note: If for disjoint set data structure you use Weighted-union heuristic linked list, you will have a running time as O(E+V+VlogV), 
which is generally not better than to use disjoint set forest with both "union by rank" and "path compression", which is almost optimal. 
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
T is a MST. It's the same as case a -- using Bridge property. 
We still separate G into two parts: V1 and V2, if there is a cycle connecting V1 and V2, 
we delete the maximum-weight edge and the smallest one will be left. So this is also equivalent to the Kruskal's algorithm.
Because each time there is at most one cycle, so Ei <= V, Ei is the number of edges in tree T in the ith iteration. 
Use DFS or BFS to check the cycle takes Big Theta(Ei+V).
finding the maximum-weight edge on c (We can record the cycle when we use DFS or BFS to travel through T) takes O(Ei);
and there are E loops(E edges in G), so the total time is O(E(Ei+V+Ei))=O(EV)

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Since each piece of string has a length of 5, you can represent
a eulerian graph given that the edges are the pieces of 5 strings.
The vertices can represent the overlap that each connected edge
has with the graph. You can then apply the Eulerian cycle and go
through all the edges and from each vertex you can construct
your main string.

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
You can do something a little similar from
when you have the same substring length.
The main difference is that there will be 
several more edges and vertices involved,
and the size of the vertices will vary depending
on the overlap. 
</VERBATIM>

---++ 4c.  More complications [5 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Continue to use the same idea from part(b)
You are just working with data which will more
likely lead to to false results.
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! ii
<VERBATIM>
If you can define the errors, then filter them out
Then use the same idea from part(b)

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
You can find my work in the attached files.
I did use visual studio to do this, and I used a tuple.
Tuples are not in g++, so my code will work in VS
I basically did a greedy algorithm, and I went through
all the edges and found the shortest distances. 
I made sure that there was no repeat.
After running through the loop, two cities were missing
so the program just added them into my cycle.
After that, I made another path from the end to the
original city.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
