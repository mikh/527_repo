|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O(n*log(n))  |
|  c  |  O(n^2)  |
|  d  |  O(n*log(n))  |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>

b. The tree is filled in a balanced manner. The height of the tree is log of the number of elements inserted in the tree, but you are adding log(n) of each number in the tree

c. Since all the repeated values are added to the tree, adding to the list give n*(n-1) + the height of the tree (log(n)). n^2 grows faster than log(n), so O(n^2). 

d. In the worst case, all the numbers would be inserted to the left or to the right.

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
sort edges into increasing order of edge weights w
G = graph
for each edge e taken in increasing order by weight, with vertices v1 and v2
  if removing this edge forms a cycle of removed edges
    move to the next edge
  else
    new_G += e
if each vertex has been visited once
      return new_G
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
I tried to implement this algorithm in the way that I step through the problem in my head/on paper. So first, create a list of the edges in increasing order. I then go through each edge in the list, and if that edge creates a cycle with the edges that have already been used to create the MST, I skip that edge and move to the next edge in the list. I iterate through this process until I have selected all of the edges that allow me to visit each vertex one time. 

Worst-case running time: O(lg(V)) --> constant time to visit the min-weight edge, constant time to detect cycle, and O(lg(V)) to remove an edge

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Line 1: Run O(E) times (implemented as a priority queue)
	Line 3: Runs for each edge --> O(E) 
		Line 4: Checks connectivity in O(lg(V)) time --> O(E*lg(V))
		Line 5: Deletes edge in O(lg(E)) time --> O(E*lg(E))
		
Thus, the total running time is O(E*lg(E))
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm doesn't always produce a minimum spanning tree; it looks at edges in arbitrary order, and only adds edges (never removes or switches edges). The arbitrary order means that it is possible to add heavier edges at the expense of lighter edges.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
Line 2: Runs O(E) times (implemented as priority queue)
		Line 3: Insert edge --> O(lg(V)) 
		Line 4: Checks for cycle in constant time (O(1))
			Line 5: Finds max-weight edge in constant time (O(1))
			Line 6: Deletes edge --> O(lg(V)) time
			
Total running time --> O(E*lg(V))
</VERBATIM>

---++!! Grader comments *[16/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
I tried to implement an algorithm that works as close to the way that I solve this particular problem in my head or on pen and paper. 

This algorithm creates a queue of reads by going through each read and tries to match the maximum number of characters to the previous read in the queue, with a particular shift value. If there are no matches, the read is sent to the bottom of the queue. 


ANALYSIS

To go through the reads takes linear time --> O(r), with r being the number of reads
To find the shift amount (worst case is length of current string built by the previous reads + 2*(length of read - 1)) --> O(s); the two is for checking two cases for the positioning of the read within the string

Running time is O(r*s).

</VERBATIM>
---+++!! ii
<VERBATIM>
My result: In orde ent hat every man must be spire penalty t his in thation present of entirit of tolerance in the e mus views withe ent his vithout pirit pentire mulatiopulathat popul

The result should be:  in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance in the entire population.

My code works with the "World Wide Web" example, but not with my string. I even added an initial condition to the reads that we given to me (The first read is the read that goes at the beginning of the sentence), and that got me closer to the quote, but still not the exact quote.
