---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  | theta(n)   |
|  c  |  theta(n)  |
|  d  | theta(n log(n))   |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
b. When inserting 2 or more copies of the same number will cause
a zig-zag between 2 branches. The total height of the tree will be 2n + log(n)/2
which means that the longest it will take to insert will be theta(n).
c. Since the repeated numbers will not be added to the binary search tree it will
not add any extra height at most this tree will take theta (n) to insert.
d. Since it is random, there is a chance that all values are mapped to the right,
 the height of the tree will be n log(n), therefore the longest it will take to insert
 will be theta( n log(n))

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
KRUSKAL(G):
1 A = &#8709;
2 foreach v &#8712; G.V:
3    MAKE-SET(v)
4 foreach (u, v) ordered by weight(u, v), increasing:
5    if FIND-SET(u) &#8800; FIND-SET(v):
6       A = A &#8746; {(u, v)}
7       UNION(u, v)
8 return A

</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Kruskal's Algorithm has a running time of Theta (E log(E))
we can use counting sort to sort the weights with time O(100E) or O(E) this changes Kruskal's to O(E)

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
theta (E^2 log(E))
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
if an edge with a large weight is taken before a smaller weight it will not produce a minimum spanning tree.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
theta(E)
assuming that the running time to check if a cycle exists is constant.
</VERBATIM>

---++!! Grader comments *[16/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
First I preprocessed the data to remove the brackets, then I inserted all the strings into an array of strings. Then I made a seed string containing some of the letters of one of the strings. Then I made a 4 letter prefix and suffix of the seed string and compared it to every other string. If the strings matched then I added the first or last letter of that string to the seed. I repeat this process until every string is used.

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
To take into account different size strings I can just manipulate the prefix and suffix to include all the letters except the first or last and I can do this by using string.size() The rest of the algorithm will be the same and compare different suffixes and prefixes.
</VERBATIM>

---++ 4c.  More complications [5 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
To take into account errors I can modify the suffix to become shorter and avoid the potential errors. Also to correct the possible missing reads I can use multiple seeds and compare each one to see if they fit together.
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! ii
<VERBATIM>
Descrbie and analyze the modification.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

My approach is to use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST and use that and turn it into a cycle.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
