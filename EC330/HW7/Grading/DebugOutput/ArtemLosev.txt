---+ Total Grade *[/100]*
---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[20 points]*
|  Approach   |  Worst Running time  | Average Running Time |
|  b  |  nlog(n)  |  log(nlog(n))  |
|  c  |  nlog(n)  |  log(nlog(n))   |
|  d  |  nlog(n)  |  log(nlog(n))  |
---++ Explanation
b) This approach (add a boolean and toggle it) adds constant time overhead, however, we have =nlog(n)= elements (=log n= copies of each of =n= numbers) </br>
c) We use =insert()= operation on a =list= which is linear in time. Thus, for every number between =1= and =n= we add linear in =log n= time overhead.</br>
d) We perform nlog(n) insertions with constant overhead (=rand()=) </br>

---++!! 2d
---+++!! Algorithm
Since the range of the values is known, we can use Kruskal's algorithm with linear-time sorting (e.g. Counting sort) to achieve linear time overall complexity.
---+++!! Analysis
O(E)

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[20 points]*
---++!! a
Running time is limited by the sorting - nlogn, unless we know the range of weights. </br>
---++!! b
This will not produce an MST every time because of the random order. The graph from problem 2 could serve as a counterexample if, for example, edge =ab= gets added randomly.</br>
---++!! c
Running time is <latex>E^{2}</latex> since for each =e= we potentially perform a linear-time overhead when we find the max-weight edge in a cycle.

---++!! Grader comments *[16/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
