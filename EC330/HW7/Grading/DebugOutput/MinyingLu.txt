---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O((logn)*(loglogn))  |
|  c  |  O(logn)  |
|  d  |  O(log^2(n))   |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide explanation for partial credits
b) assume there 's 10 new node z that's replicates of node x, every x that's already in the tree will directed the new node z to either x.left or x.right. 
    and there's logn copies of each number, the height of the "sub-tree" of each number and its copies will have height = loglogn. 
    which makes the height of the whole tree to be loglogn times bigger than when there's no replicates. 
    Therefore the running time is O((logn)*(loglogn))

c)Because add value to a list takes constant time, and the list on the node doesn't change the height of the tree. 
   the overall insertion time will still be O(logn)

d)It is similar to (b), but worse, because it randomly set x to x.left or x.right.
    The worst case will be always setting x to x.left (or x.right). Then the height of the tree will be logn times higher than the general case
    The running time will be O(log^2(n))

Does this graph exhibit the triangle inequality? 
No it doesn't because it doesn't form any triangles, it's a tree (Star Graph)

<pre>
Kruskal's algorithm takes the smallest edge that doesn't form a circle
1. A - E = 3    {A, E}
2. E - C = 7    {A, E, C}
3. B - D = 15   {B, D}
4. D - F = 28   {B, D, C} 
5. F - C = 32   {B, D, C, F}

The Graph will be {A, E, B, D, C, F}

---++!! 2d
---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Describe your algorithm here. Pseudocode is preferred.
I will use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. Assuming "general case" means E is not significantly larger than V. 

//psuedocode 
save all vertices into a disjoint set data structure
P[] = empty array
for each v belongs to V,
    make-set (v)
sort all edges into non-decreasing order by weight
for each edge e: (u, v) in the sorted graph
    if find-set(u) != find-set(v)
         P = P union with {(u, v)}
         union(u, v)
return P
</VERBATIM>

---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V) <= make-set for all v belong to V
O(ElogE) <= sorting the graph
O(logV) <= for each loop for an edge
O(ElogV) <= for the whole graph

In general, this algorithm takse Theta(ElogV) time.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
This is a minimum spanning tree

Runtime:
O(ElogE) <= sort edge into non-increasing order
Theta(E) <= save E to T
O(E) <= worst case running time for checking if T - {e} is a connected graph
             per loop

Total running time: O(E^2logE)
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
This is NOT a minimum spanning tree.

Counter example:
Because T takes edge in in arbitrary order, and union it with the current T. 
A --2--B--4--C--10--A (connected undirected graph)
T could be A -> C -> B, while the minimum spanning tree should be A -> B -> C
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This is NOT a minimum spanning tree.

Counterexample:
graph A--2--B--3--C--7--D--4--A (connected undirected cycle)
also    B--5--D

Assume the algorithm goes from B -> A -> D -> B, finds a cycle,
eliminate the max-weight edge (B--5--D)
but because MST-C takes edge e in arbitary order
it could take the edge (C--7--D) as its next edge
and the resulting tree will be B->A->D->C, which is not a MST.

(c) works correctly. First running time is O(E^2).

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Describe:
This algorithm will save the first element of the substring array in to result string, and iterate through the array, 
if the substring is not used, compare the first four character of result with the last four characters of the current substring; 
compare the last four characters of the result and the first four characters of the current substring. once it found a match, 
it will either append the substring to the front of result or the back. 
The boolean array used[] which keep track of if the substring is used or not, 
when all the substring are used, the function will exit out of the while loop and print result.

Analysis:
the worst case running time will be O(n^2)

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.
I made a minimum spanning tree using prim's algorithm, and tried to use preorder function to visit the nodes in the mst.
I was able to construct the mst, but my preorder function throws segmentation fault error. 
So I couldn't produce a result.txt.....

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
