---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide explanation for partial credits

b. To insert m copies of a number, it takes (m/2)^2 time, i.e. (m^2)/4 time.
    To insert m copies of n numbers, it takes sum from i = 0 to i = n of (m^2)/4, i.e. ((m^2)/4)^2 = (m^4)/16.
    So now if m = log(n), it takes O((log(n))^4)/16) time.

c. To insert m copies of a number, it takes (m^2) time.
    To insert one copy n numbers, it'll take sum for i = 0 to i = n of i, i.e. (n^2) time.
    So to insert m copies of n numbers it'll take (m^2)*(n^2) time.
    So now if m = log(n), it takes O((log(n)^2)*(n^2)) time.

d. Worst case to insert m copies of a number would be (m^2) time.
    Worst case to insert m copies of n numbers would be ((m^2)^2) = (m^4) time.
    So now if m = log(n), it takes O((log(n))^4) time.

|  Chichen Itza, Yuc., Mexico  |  56  |
|  CN Tower, 301 Front Street West, Toronto, ON M5V 2T6, Canada  |  9  |
|  Pyramid of the Sun, San Juan Teotihuacán, 55800 Teotihuacán de Arista, State of Mexico, Mexico  |  43  |
|  Statue of Liberty National Monument, Liberty Island, New York, NY  |  4  |
|  Mandalay Bay, 3950 South Las Vegas Boulevard, Las Vegas, NV 89119  |  39  |

Does this graph exhibit the triangle inequality? 

No it doesn't. From the table above, (9 + 4) = 13 which is < {56, 43, 39}.

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Describe your algorithm here. Pseudocode is preferred.

/*
 * The idea is to make a hybrid from Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.
 * Assume MST-PRIM and MST-KRUSKAL to be the same algorithms from the textbook, p631 and p634.
 * Assume that the KRUSKAL implementation uses the disjoint-set-forest implementation ...
 *    ... with the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics.
 * Assume that the PRIM implementation uses a Fibonacci Heap implement the min-priority queue.
 */

Find_MST (G, w):
begin:
     If G is dense:
          MST-PRIM (G, w)
     else:
          MST-KRUSKAL (G, w)
end

</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Descrbie and analyze your algorithm.

Here, the PRIM implementation takes O(E + V*lg(V)) time and the KRUSKAL implementation takes O(E*lg(V)) time.
Therefore, when the graph is dense, the PRIM implementation is used yielding a worst-case of O(E + V*lg(V)) time.
But when the graph is not dense, the KRUSKAL implementation is used yielding a worst-case of O(E*lg(V)) time.

Counterexample or Running time

This algorithm does not yield a Minimum Spanning Tree. Counterexample:

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.
<VERBATIM>

Explanation:

     Basically, I used a graph header file to create a graph of the map. Then I edited the map so that only edges that were symmetric 
existed, turning the graph into an undirected graph. Then I used Prim's algorithm to create an MST and then I performed a preorder
walk on this MST.

Resulting Weight: 185413

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
