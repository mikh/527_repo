---+++!! Algorithm

<VERBATIM>

void Kruskal(Graph&g){
E=empty set;
for each in g.vertex
  create a disjoint_set(v)
sort edges in Graph in ascending order;
for (each v1,v2 of one edge)
  if  find(v1)!=find(v2)
       add these vertices to E empty set
       unite them
return E;
}
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
First I create an empty set. Then for each vertex I create new disjoint set. 
I would sort them in an ascending order. And for each case, if  vertices are not equal,
I add them to the initially created empty set, and unite them.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm does always produce a minimum spanning tree. 
An asymptotically tight running time would be O(E logV).
 Although, Depth First Search could increase it to O (E^2 + EV)
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm does NOT always produce a minimum spanning tree.
The reason is because the edges are in arbitrary order, as a result
it fails every time for any tree with NOT always sorted edge list. 
The actual checking is computed just to make sure that there is no 
cycles at all. It does not always do it for minimum paths.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm does always produce a minimum spanning tree.
The third line takes constant time, while lines four, five, and six
can be done in O(V) time. As the loop goes through adj list that
is computed in O(E) time. As a result, the running time would be
O(VE)
</VERBATIM>

---++!! Grader comments *[18/10]*
<VERBATIM>
Last running time is O(EV + E^2).

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
