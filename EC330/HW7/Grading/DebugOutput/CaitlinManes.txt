|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  log(n) * n  |
|  c  |  n  |
|  d  |  log(n) * n  |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
(b) I am assuming that if x.b = true use x.left, and if x.b = false use x.right.
     Also, I am assuming the x.b is false initially.
     I started with the case n = 10^2. This means that I insert two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, etc.
     I inserted the first 1 and set x.b to false. I then inserted the second 1 to the right and set x.b to true.
     Following this pattern, I inserted my next two 2's. Each was inserted into the rightmost position in the tree.
     If all the keys 1...10^2 are inserted, the tree height will be log(10^2) * 10^2 = 2 * 10^2 = 200 when all the keys
     are inserted. The last insert time will be 200. It is the worst case insert time of log(n) * n.

(c) I am assuming the list at each node is a linked list.
     If a list of nodes with equal keys at x is kept, then adding repeat keys will not affect the height.
     If they don't affect the height, then they won't affect the insert time other than at the node where the key is being inserted.
     For example, if n = 10^2, inserting two 1's, two 2's, and two 3's will given me a tree of height 3 since each key is inserted
     in the rightmost position of the tree. Inserting the second 3 will be 3 + 1 = 4. If this pattern is continued all the way up to n,
     then the height will be n. The worst case of inserting will then be (log(n) - 1) + n. n for how many keys the last key will have
     to traverse, and (log(n) - 1) for how many keys will already be in the list.

(d) I am assuming that each node randomly sets x to x.right.
     If each x inserts keys with the same value to the right, then the height will grow to be log(n) * n since each key inserted is
     equal to x or greater. Each key will be inserted into the rightmost position.

Does this graph exhibit the triangle inequality? 

Yes, every side of a given triangle in the graph is always shorter than the sum of the other two sides.

---++!! 2d
---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Describe your algorithm here. Pseudocode is preferred.

I would use Kruskal's algorithm since the running time is E * log E.

Kruskal's Algorithm:

make-set(x): makes components containing only x
union(x): pin components containing x to y
find-set(x): return representative of x

Kruskal:
	sort all edges
	make-set(v) for each v belongs to V
	for each edge e(u->v):
		if find-set(u) != find-set(v):
			union(u,v)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
</VERBATIM>

Running time union: &#920;(E log E) + &#920;(V log V) + &#920;(E) = &#920;(E log E)

     sort: &#920;(E log E)

     make-set: &#920;(1)

     find-set: &#920;(1)

     union: &#920;(log V)

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm always produces a minimum spanning tree.
It takes E time to sort the edges into nonincreasing order or edge weights.
It then takes E time to go through each edge and subtract it from the graph.
Letting e represent the edge number currently on in the loop, it will take E-(#number of edges removed) time to see if the graph is still connected.
</VERBATIM>

Total complexity will be E best case. (Starting tree has only one node.)

Total complexity will bee <latex>E^2</latex> worst case. (Graph is already a minimum spanning tree.)
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm does not always produce a minimum spanning tree.
Take this tree:

a   c-----e---g
 \ /  \  /   /
  b----d----f

where the weights are:
a-b = 5, b-c = 4, b-d = 3, c-d = -2, c-e = 6, d-e = 5, d-f = 86, e-g = 9, and f-g = 11.

Since each edge is added in arbitrary order, the edge d-f can be added first since it does not create a cycle in T.
Other edges that don't create a cycle can then be added.
A possible tree given by the algorithm could be:

a   c     e---g
 \ /  \  /
  b    d----f

This graph has the edge with 86 in it, making for this to not be a minimum spanning tree for the original graph.

</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm always produces a minimum spanning tree.
The outer for loop takes E time since it iterates over all the edges.
Each edge is added and a cycle is checked for. Checking for the cycle will take (# number of edges in T) time.
This will be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + E total time for the algorithm.
</VERBATIM>

Total complexity will be <latex>\sum_{k=1}^{E}k = \Theta(E^2)</latex> time.

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
All complexities are worst case.

Adding words to graph:
(1) Algorithm adds all words from file to words vector. Takes V^2 time.
(2) For each word in words vector, a word is searched for that matches the 4 letter prefix or the 4 letter suffix of a current edge.
     All edges are searched. This takes E time. (V^2*E for step 1 and 2)
(3) If a match was found for either or both while searching, the loop searching through the vertices is broken and an edge is added.
(4) At this point all the edges have been added for each word.

Finding path:
(5) The start id is found (a vertex that has no edges going to it). All the vertices are searched until one is found. This takes VE time.
(6) Each vertex is color white. Takes V time.
(7) dfsVisit() is called on the start vertex, then on all the vertices. Takes V + 1 time.
(8) In dfsVisit(), the vertex colored grey.
(9) All the neighbors for that vertex are iterated through. This takes E time.
(10) If there is more than neighbor, a check is done to see how many of those neighbors have been visited. This takes the individual
       vertex's edge time (e).
(11) If at least one of the neighbors has not been visited, all the vertex's edges are iterated through. This takes e time.
(12) If there is more than one neighbor, each neighbor is iterated through and has doesPathReturn() called on it until doesPathReturn() returns true.
       This takes e time.
(13) dfsVisit() is then called on either the original vertex or the chosen vertex.
(14) When dfsVisit() terminates, the vertex is pushed onto a stack and the vertex is colored black.
(15) In doesPathReturn() the path is followed until either the path returns or until a vertex is encountered that has to edges leaving it. This takes E time.
(16) When dfsVisit() returns, all the the vertices on the stack are popped. This takes V time.

Getting Quote:
(17) The vertices in the path are used to find the quote. This takes V time.

For complexity's, I'm assuming e is small enough to not be considered.

Complexity for adding words to graph is: V^2 * E.
Complexity for finding path is: VE + V*E^2 + V.
Complexity for getting quote is: V.
Total Complexity: O(V^2*E + VE + V*E^2 + 2V).

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
Adding words to the graph was modified:
The way the suffix is compared to the prefix was changed by changing the bounds when taking the substrings. This does not add complexity.

Getting Quote:
Getting the quote was changed. The previous value added to the quote is stored. It is checked against the current value to add to see where they overlap. So each string is iterated through. This adds n^2 complexity to getting the quote. The total complexity for getting a quote is now V*n^2 where n is how many letters are in the quote

Total Complexity: O(V^2*E + VE + V*E^2 + V + V*n^2).

The code was tested against the reads: [ello ] [lo world] [llo wo] [hell].

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle


<VERBATIM>
Code Explanation:

I used an adjacency matrix. I started with the beginning vertex "ETCW". I used a
greedy algorithm and selected the smallest edge to a vertex that hadn't been used
yet as my next edge in the path. I incremented the vertex's in degree when I added
the vertex to the path. I then go through all the vertices and if their in degree is 0, I
find a min edge from another vertex (not the beginning) and back to the vertex. Then in
the last loop, I look for a path back to the beginning vertex. I do this by continuously
selected min edges until its neighbor is the beginning vertex.
