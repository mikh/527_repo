---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O((log(n))<sup>3</sup>  |
|  c  |  O((log(n))<sup>2</sup>)  |
|  d  |  O(n(log(n))<sup>2</sup>)  |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
b - navigating to x takes O(log(n)), going down left or right (balanced since it alternates) until it doesn't match takes another O(log(n)), and there are log(n) items so the total runtime is O(log(n) * log(n) * log(n)).
c - navigating to x takes O(log(n)), adding to the list takes O(1), and there are log(n) items so the total runtime is O(log(n) * log(n)).
d - navigating to x takes O(log(n)), going down left or right (randomly, worst case scenario is all the same so O(n), and there are log(n) items so the total runtime is O(n * log(n) * log(n)).

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
A = empty disjoint-set
for each vertex v
    make-set(v)
for each edge (u, v) in increasing weight
    if find-set(u) != find-set(v):
        add the edge (u, v) to A
        union(u, v)
return A
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
This is an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm using a the disjoint-set data structure, which runs in O(E log V) time.
(Sorting the edges takes O(E log E) time, followed by the O(V) disjoint-set operations which takes O(log V) time.)

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
O(E(V + E))
Sort Edges: can be done in O(E)
For each edge: theta(E)
    Check if connected: can be done with DFS in O(V + E)
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample:
A graph with vertices A, B, and C that have edges AB, BC, and AC with weights 1, 2, and 4 respectively, when run through this algorithm, might have the incorrect result of AC-BC because edges are taken in arbitrary order.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
O(E(V + E))
For each edge: theta(E)
    Check if cycle: can be done with DFS in O(V + E) time

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
O(n):    open file and store reads in a vector of strings
O(n^2):  for each read:
             for each other read: O(n)
                 if first 4 characters of next read matches last 4 characters of current read
                     add next read to adjacency list
         let R = first read (as a string)
O(n):    for each read:
             add the last letter of next read to r
         return R
This algorithm runs in O(n^2) time.

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
replace this line:
    if first 4 characters of next read matches last 4 characters of current read
with this:
    let sLen = size of smaller read
    if first sLen characters of next read matches last sLen characters of current read
So different sized reads will not cause an error since the smaller one is being used for matching.
</VERBATIM>

---++ 4c.  More complications [5 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Remove duplicates, store all the reads as a graph, and try to find a TSP solution.
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! ii
<VERBATIM>
Do a probability analysis based on the properties of the DNA extraction process and already-known sequences and adjust each character accordingly.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Cycle weight: 498562<br/>
I stored the graph as an adjacency list, then looped through starting from the given start vertex ETCW, finding the minimum<br/>
weight edge that didn't connect to a vertex that was already added and adding that to the result.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
