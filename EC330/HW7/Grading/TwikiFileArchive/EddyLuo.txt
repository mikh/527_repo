---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
insertion takes O(h) time where h is the height of the tree at the point of insertion
b.
First insert a group of 1s going to the left first and then alternate left and right.
Then place a 2 to the right of all the 1s. The location of the next number is at layer
m*ceil(log2(x+2)), where m is the current number being used and x is the number of copies.
For example, the location of the 2 is on layer 1*ceil(log2(10+2))=1*4=4 if there are 10 copies.
The time it takes to insert log(n) copies of 1 is worst-case O(log(n)^2).
The time it takes to insert log(n) copies of m is worst-case O(m*log2(log(n))*log(n)^2).
Therefore the time it takes to do this for n numbers is O(n^2*log2(log(n))*log(n)^2).

c.
Adding new nodes only takes O(1) time once x is reached. Therefore, the time it takes to reach a node is m time, where m is the number to reach. To fill a number up takes m*log(n) time. Since log(n) is constant, the optimum time is O(n^2 log(n)).

d.
Randomly, it's possible that x is always x.right.
There are n*log(n) numbers to insert. This means that the worst case is the sum
of all numbers from 1 to n*log(n).
Therefore the worst-case is O(n^2*log^2(n)).

<VERBATIM>
// Kruskal's Algorithm

class edge {
  public:
    vertex left; // vertex 1 of graph
    vertex right; // vertex 2 of graph
    int weight;
};

vector<edge> sortedEdges = allEdges.sort(); // sort all edges by weight. Best results through radix sort due to the small weight maximum, given that all weights are integers.
// takes 2E time to sort them

vector<edge> minTree;
vector<trees> allTrees;
for (vertex in Tree) { // V time
    allTrees.push_back(tree(vertex)); convert all vertices to trees
}

for (edgeIterator it = allEdges.begin(); it != allEdges.end(); it++) { // E time
    if (it->left.getTree() != it->right.getTree()) { // if trees are different 
        minTree.push_back(*it);
    }
}

return minTree;
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
All of the procedures are done in linear time, so this runs in O(E) time.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
creates a MST

1. sort the edges takes E log E time
2. checks each edge: E time
3. checks if T - {e} is a connected graph (using DFS or BFS: V+E time)

This takes O((V+E)(E^2 log E)) time.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Doesn't always produce a minimum spanning tree.

Let's say there's a graph with 3 vertices. The weight from 1 to 2 is 10. The weight from 1 to 3 is 2. The weight from 2 to 3 is 3.
The best algorithm would connect 1 and 3, then 2 and 3 to make a minimum spanning tree.
However, this algorithm may possibly take the 10-weight edge first, which would not create a minimum spanning tree, 
although it creates no cycles.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
1. take each edge: E time
2. checks for cycle: E time
3. finds maximum weight edge: E time

This takes O(E^3) time.

First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle

Explanation: Uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path to the next unused vertex.

After visiting all vertices successfully, the program returns back to the original vertex.
