---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  | Explanation |
|  b  |   Theta n*(h+(log(log(n)))^2)| for every n the height of the tree increases by log(log(n)) so the the summation is theta (log(log(n)))^2 and it traverses the tree n times| 
|  c  |  Theta n*h*log(n)| There are log n inserts for every n number and insert-tree take theta (h) |
|  d  |  Theta n*(h+(log(n))^2)| so for every n the height of the tree increases at most log n levels (inserting on same side) and the summation would be theta  log(n)^2 so traversing the tree takes h+log(n)^2 and this is done n times |

I would use Kruskal's algorithm which takes Theta (E log V).

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Running time.

Yes this would find the MST since it goes through all the 
edges in nonincreasing order and removes the edges 
only if removing the edges would still result in a connected 
graph so the the tree would still span the entire graph and 
so the larger edges that aren't necessary are removed. 

The runtime for this algorithm assuming we are using an 
adjacency list representation for T would be O(E^2)
because sorting the edges in nonincreasing order would
 take at least O( E log E) using Merge-Sort, then using 
BFS or DFS to traverse the tree and check if T- {e} is 
connected graph would take O(V+ E) and this would
 be done for all the E edges so the total run time would 
be O(E log E + E (V +E))= O (E^2).

</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample 

No this algorithm would not return a MST because
it takes each edge in arbitrary order and so it may 
chose edges that don't result in a cycle, but also don't 
for a MST. For example, a simple undirected graph 
with three vertices a, b, c and edges a-b, b-c, a-c
each with a weight 3, 4. 5. This algorithm may 
chose edges b-c and a-c as the MST which has a
weight of 9 however this is incorrect. The MST includes 
edges a-b and b-c which has a weight of 7.   


</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
Running time

Yes, this algorithm does produce a MST because
it adds edges in arbitrary order and when a cycle
is detected it removes the largest edge in the cycle 
and going through all edges in this manner would 
result in a MST.

The runtime, assuming we are using an adjacency list
representation for T, would be O(E*V) because adding 
and edge take constant time O(1) and DFS takes O(V) 
for this algorithm because the number of edges in T 
will never be greater than V because every time a cycle 
is found an edge is removed. Finding the maximum edge
weight takes O(V) and deleting an edge also takes O(V). And 
since this is done for all E edges the runtime would be O(E*V).

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the algorithm.
I was able to successfully extract the reads, create prefixes and suffixes using the first four 
and last four characters respectively, and eliminate all the duplicate entries. I was planning 
use the nodes2 string array as my vertices for the graph and the reads for the edges; however 
I was unable to complete this portion. 

Allocating the read, prefix, and suffix arrays take Theta(n) where n is the number of reads. 
I used the sort function from the the algorithms stl and that takes Theta(n log n).
And lastly I wend through the entire nodes array to eliminate repeating nodes, which takes
theta(N). So my algorithm thus far takes Theta(N log N).

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
Describe and analyze the modification
In order to deal with reads of different lengths the only thing that would change
is the length of the prefixes and suffixes. And so the nodes would be different lengths. 
So when matching a read edge to it's prefix and suffix node it would still be the same comparison. 
This modification would not change the run time. It would take just as long to create the nodes 
Theta(n) and to sort them Theta(n log n) where n is the number of reads. 
</VERBATIM>

---++ 4c.  More complications [5 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Descrbie and analyze the modification.

In order to deal with reads with complications at the end the suffix node can be create to simply
take in a substring of the suffix and drop letters at the end based on some condition.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Applying Prim's algorithm to this file would find the MST, since none of the distances are negative.  


Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
