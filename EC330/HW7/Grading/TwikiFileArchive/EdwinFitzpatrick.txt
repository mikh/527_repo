---++!! 2d
---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Because we know the range of values, we can use a counting sort instead of a general sorting algorithm to bring the sorting portion of Kruskal's algorithm down to linear time rather than ElogE. Sorting is the longest portion of a traditional Kruskal's algorithm, so the next longest running portion will become the limiting factor.
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
**assuming we can use a blackbox disjoint set data structure**
- Counting sort by weight of edges in disjoint set [O(E)]
- merge vertices connected by smallest weight edges that do not form a cycle. [O(E)]

therefore run time will be O(E)

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Yes, it will work

This is essentially doing Kruskal's algorithm in reverse. Instead of adding smallest weight edges you are taking away largest weight edges. This will work well in sparse, but still connected graphs and will run in the same time given it's going the same computations O(ElogV)
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Will not work

If edges are taken in arbitrary order it is perfectly possible that the algorithm will miss smallest edges therefore not creating a MST.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This will work as it is essentially adding edges, then taking out the largest unnecessary edges, although will not do it quickly.

The first line needs to be repeated E times
second line we assume is constantly time
third line must check to see if there is a newly created cycle, which will take E time
if there is a cycle, it must remove the largest edge, which will take constant time

So the final running time should be O(E^2)
</VERBATIM>
---++!! Grader comments *[18/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2).

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
