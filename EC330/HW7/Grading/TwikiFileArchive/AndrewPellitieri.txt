---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O(log(log(n)) * nlog(n))  |
|  c  |  n^2 * log(n)  |
|  d  |  n^2(log(n))^2  |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
b) The original in the book would be a balanced tree and would thus take n*log(n) to construct
now we need to multiply the height of that by log(n).. but not quiet, because that (log(n)) of each copy
would also be balanced, so that height difference is actually log(n) plugged into the original log(log(n))

c) if you're just using a list of nodes at x it takes n time to make that list, now if you're doing that linear
operation with log(n) copies that means you have to multiply the run time by log(n), but the linked list will also eventually be size n so its going to take n^2 to insert

d) worst case for d is n^2 if random because it could randomize to the same direction.  with log(n) copies
this is actually (n*(log(n)))^2

---++!! 2d
---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
//N.B. This homework was done in collaboration with Max Li
//Algorithm:

make-set(x) //makes component containing only c
union (x, y) //joins the connected components containing x and y
find-set(x) //returns the representative of x

Kruskals()
 make-set(v) for each v in V

 for each edge e from u to v
    if find-set(u) != find set(v)
      union(u,v)

}
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
According to sources found online there was a bit of debate but Kruskals seemed to out perform Prim's algorithm with sparse graphs
since it uses simpler data structures

(this is after a few hours of conflicting sources and youtube videos explaining the two algortihms, a majority answer was decided on).

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
This also give a minimum spanning tree with runtime of O(E^2).
If you use adjacency list you can sort in Elog(E) and you can depth first search in V+E
Once edges are sorted depth first is done E times, and you end up truncating the (E*(V+E)) to E^2
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Not a minimum spanning tree.  For counter example, if a graph has edges (w,u) and (v,w) with a weight of 3,
then it will add edges in a random order, it could add edges (u,v) and (v, w) and then try to add (w, u), but this will for a cycle.
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This does give a minimum spanning tree.  It adds edges in arandom order and if cycle is detected removes the maximum weight edge.  Using an adjacency list, add each edge to a graph and check for cycles, then depth first search.  Total runtime should be O(V* E)
</VERBATIM>

---++!! Grader comments *[18/20]*
<VERBATIM>
Last running time should be O(E(V+E)).
</VERBATIM>

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
For this part I was thinking of ways to implement a eulearean cycle algorithm.  The structure I was thinking of using was a directed graph.  Unfortunately with other major projects and exams this week I didn't get anyything functioning up and running for this portion.

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found:

Again, as with the issue above I was trying to use the approach discussed in office hours with finding minimum spanning tree and using a depth first search, but I was having general issues getting code to run
and given time constraints and the precedence I was not able to get anything worth uploading unfortunately, sorry for the lack of solution.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
