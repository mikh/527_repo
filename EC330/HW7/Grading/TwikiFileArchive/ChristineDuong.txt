|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  n<sup>2</sup>logn *log(logn)  |
|  c  |  n<sup>2</sup>logn  |
|  d  |  (nlogn)<sup>2</sup>  |
---++ Explanation
b. If we have logn copies of numbers from 1 to n, then the height of a tree for any single number is log(logn). Then there are n of these trees which, because of the constant increase in keys, the total height of the tree will be nlog(logn). We then need to do nlogn insertions, so the total time should be O(n<sup>2</sup>logn*log(logn)).<br>
c. If we add the item to the front of the list, this will take constant time. This means the height of the tree will just be n and with nlogn insertions, the total time should be O(n<sup>2</sup>logn).<br>
d. Worst case is that they all end up on one side (in a long chain) which will be of height nlogn. With nlogn insertions this is O((nlogn)<sup>2</sup>).

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Because the graph is complete Prim's algorithm utilizing a linked list will be suitable for finding a MST.


Place all vertices (ordered) in a queue
key[v]=infinity for all v except the root
key[root] = 0

while queue!=empty
    u=extract-min(queue)
    for each vertex v adjacent to u
        if v is in queue and w(u,v) <key[v]
            key[v]=w(u,v)
            pi[v]=u
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
Because it is a dense graph we should utilize a linked list to represent the queue. If we do so the algorithm will run in O(V<sup>2</sup>).

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a

---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
           a
        /      \
       b--------c

Let w(a,b) = 1
      w(b,c) = 2
      w(c,a) = 3
</VERBATIM>

We can easily see that the minimum spanning tree should have edges {a,b} and {b,c} giving us an overall weight of 3. However, Maybe-MST in this case chooses an edge to add arbitrarily so it is possible it will choose edges {b,c} and {c,a} which would lead to a weight of 5 which is not the MST.

---+ Problem 4.  DNA sequencing *[20 points]*

---++ 4a.  Simple case [10 points]
---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
After reading in all of the strings which I will call fragments:
Make each fragment a vertex in a graph (which I called text).
If the last four characters of a fragment matches the first four characters of another fragment, let there be a directed edge from the first to the second.
Then, let there be a stack and a path; both of which are empty:
-Push onto the stack the first fragment of the overall string (this will be the only fragment with 0 in-degree, which can easily be checked for when we're adding edges to the graph).
-While the stack isn't empty:
    -Look at the top of the stack. If this fragment/vertex has a neighbor:
        -Push the neighbor onto the stack
        -Delete the edge that you just used to travel to this neighbor
    -Otherwise (there are no neighbors):
        -Add this element to our path 
        -Pop it off the stack 

Go through the path in reverse to get the strings in order. (You can just print the first string, last character of every in between string, and then the last string to get the overall string). 

If V is the number of fragments, and E is the number of directed edges, then it takes O(V<sup>2</sup>) to populate the graph and then O(V+E) to find the path/string. If E is ~V, then it will be O(V<sup>2</sup>) to populate and O(V) to find the path.

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>
This part is very similar to part =a= except if a fragment is a substring of another fragment, do not add it into the graph as a vertex. 
For vertex v1 and vertex v2:
-If v1 is smaller than v2: If the v1.length()-1 last characters of v1 match with v1.length()-1 first characters of v2, then make a directed edge from vertex 1 to 2.
-If v2 is smaller than v1: if the v2.length()-1 last characters of v1 match with the v2.length()-2 first characters of v2, then make a directed edge from vertex 1 to 2. 

This should have the same run time.

---+++!! i
<VERBATIM>
Similar to b, if we encounter a string that is a repeat (or substring of another string), just delete/not include it in the graph. 
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! ii
<VERBATIM>
(At least to my knowledge) there's no easy way of knowing what the original string is if there are errors at the end of the reads. If the reads are relatively long, I think we can have a good idea if we see if 90% of the end of read1 matches with the beginning of read2. If that holds true, we can assume there may be a directed edge from read1 to read2. 
</VERBATIM>

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

After creating classes to represent the graph and the weighted edges, I used a greedy algorithm -- I looked for the cheapest neighbor to the city I was currently looking at. I would then continue this until I reached the correct number of edges or I noticed a cycle. 

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
