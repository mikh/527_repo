---+ Problem 1. Binary Search Trees *[10 points]*
|  Approach   |  Running time  |
|  b  |  O(n(log(n))^2)  |
|  c  |  O(1)  |
|  d  |  O((logn)^2)  |
---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
For B- eight of the tree is log n and we are inserting nlogn numbers.  Therefore it is n(logn)^2

For C- this insert is done like inserting an element to the end of a linked list which is done in constant time.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm does always produce a minimum spanning tree.  The running time is O(E(E+V))
</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm does not produce a minimum spanning tree, but rather just produces a spanning tree.  If the edges in the for loop were not taken in an arbitrary order and were ordered according to their weight, then this algorithm would produce a minimum spanning tree. 
</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm does produce a minimum spanning tree.  The run time is O(VE)

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle
