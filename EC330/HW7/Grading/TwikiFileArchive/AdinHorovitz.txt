---++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>

Explanation 
Basic assumption - every input entails nlog(n) entries. Because every number from 1 to n is entered log(n) times here.
b) the original algorithm will insert n equal elements in O(n log n) time, creating a balanced tree (or subtree).
- our number of nodes - log(n) nodes per tree (e.g. 10 1's, 10 2's...), n total subtrees (one for each term 1...n).
- trees are of height lg(nodes per tree), so each subtree is height lg(log(n))
- each new subtree will go down the right branch (larger than the last subtree)
-- although subtrees are balanced, the whole tree is not balanced.
-- so, n subtrees * log(n) entries per tree * max height of lg(log(n)) == n * log (n) * lg(log(n)) -> which is close enough to n * log^2(n)

c) the original algorithm gives you a one node tree with a list, and is O(n) for n * list insertion is O(1)
- insert and search for BST are O(h) or O(lg n), but this won't be balanced.
- max height of the tree is going to be n, as each successive node will be larger.
-- this will essentially be a linked list of linked lists.
-- traversal of the main linked list will be O(n) as the list grows
--- sublists will only have insertions - O(1)
- list traversal O(n) * total number of terms O(n log n) * insertion O(1)
-- total O(n^2 * log (n))

d) worst case is if the probability of choosing one branch is 1.
-in this case, you essentially get a linked list of all terms.
-full traversal of a linked list and adding to the end is O(n^2)
- substitute n log n terms...  O((nlogn)^2) = O(n^2 * log(n)^2)

---+++!! Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
As described by CLRS, here's the trusty PRIM algorithm.

PRIM(V, E,w,r)
Q <- {empty}
for each u in V
  do key[u] <- infinity
       pi[u] <- NIL
    INSERT(Q, u) DECREASE-KEY(Q,r,0)

while Q =/= {empty}
  do u <- EXTRACT-MIN(Q)
    for each v in; Adj[u]
      do if v in Q and w(u, v) < key[v]
        then pi[v] <- u 
         DECREASE-KEY(Q,v,w(u,v))

</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>

If Q is a binary heap:

Create Q, run through first for loop                   -- O(V lg(V))
Decrease key of r                                              -- O(lg(V))
while loop -- V x EXTRACT-MIN                       == O(V lg(V))
    -- but E x DECREASE-KEY                          == O(E lg(V))
    -- given that V < E here, total for while loop is O(E lg(V))
Total = O(E lg(V))

Fibonacci heaps can do the function DECREASE-KEY in O(1) amortized time, so the while loop would become O(V lg(V) + E).

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*

All problems in this assignment were completed in collaboration with Josh Joseph
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>

MAYBE-MST-A does always produce MST (like reverse-Kruskal's)

The edge removals from Maybe-MST-A keep an MST if the graph remains connected. 
By definition, each time, we will be removing the largest remaining edge.
(this is basically a reworking of theorem 23.1 earlier in the chapter).

Check: 
Establish T via an adjacency list representation for T . 
Merge-Sort edges                                                                                    -- O(E log E) x one time
Check whether T - {e} is connected via BFS or DFS                               -- O(V +E)  x E times

Total = O(E log E + E(V + E))
==
O(E^2).


</VERBATIM>
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
No. MAYBE-MST-B does NOT always produce MST

Take a simple cycle graph (A, B, C):
</VERBATIM>


|  | A | B | C |
| A | 0 | 4 | 7 |
| B | 4 | 0 | 2 |
| C | 7 | 2 | 0 |

<VERBATIM>

Since Maybe-MST-B adds randomly, if it adds AB and AC, it will end, as BC will create a cycle.
Except, that T will equal 11, while an MST of BC and BA would have a value of 6 (MST).

</VERBATIM>
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>

This will work - it's basically an unwieldy version of MST-relaxing.

Use an adjacency list.                            --Adding an edge is O(1) 
Use DFS to check for a cycle                 --  O(V + E) = O(V) 

.....Max number of cycles at any one time = 1, which means every pair of vertices in the graph
    only has one edge, and the additional edge to form a cycle will mean E = V

Linear search of the edges to find the the maximum-weight edge on the cycle will be O(V) 
deleting an edge -- O(V). 

Doing this for all edges will multiply the process by E.
E * (add(1) + DFS(2V) + (possible linear search(V) + possible delete(V)))
= E * (1 + 4V)
= EV

Total
O(EV)

     // If no overlapping reads were found (Can't happen with simplified problem)

The GET_OVR() function runs in constant time, and is called O(n^2) times. 

Therefore, overall worst-case asymptotic runtime = O(n^2).

---++ 4b.  Complications [5 points]
<VERBATIM>

How to accommodate multiple read lengths depends on whether overlap of neighboring reads is still constant:
   If it is, nothing needs to change:
     -->My original algorithm simply tests for Right or Left overlap of 4 characters,
     and varying string lengths would make no difference.  Runtime = O(n^2)

   If overlap of neighboring reads is NOT constant, the GET_OVR() function must be rewritten:
     --> A modified Knuth-Miller-Pratt (KMP) algorithm can be implemented to accommodate 3 situations:
         1) Partial overlap on the Left -- MERGE like Left neighbor situation in simple case
         2) Full overlap of smaller read with middle of longer read -- Just throw away smaller Read
         3) Partial overlap on the Right -- MERGE like Right neighbor situation.....
       
     --> KMP runs in Theta (N), where N is the length of the "text," or longer read
     --> Setup of KMP would take Theta (M) time, where M is the length of the "pattern"
     --> Some additional processing would be needed to perform "partial KMP" with overlap situations 1,3.
            This additional computation would be bound by Theta(M).

In summary, this new GET_OVR() function would still be called O(n^2) times, but it is no longer a constant
function call 

--> total runtime = O(n^2*(N+M))

N and M being the average lengths of "text" and "pattern" reads.

A rigorous algorithm for shotgun sequencing DNA reads with varying length, single-nucleotide errors (point mutations), and subsequence deletions/over-amplification (frameshift mutations) would be computationally
intensive. Firstly, the source DNA would need to be digested/spliced at enough distinct sequence positions
to ensure sufficiently redundant coverage of any given subsequence. This is because some of the reads 
covering a given subsequence will have errors, and a correction must be made based on consensus among 
all reads covering the subsequence.

As such, the disjoint-set approach used in the simpler versions of this problem would not
work. A complete, weighted graph must be constructed with vertices representing the reads, and edge weights
representing the minimum hamming distance between all read pairs. In addition, the edges would have to track
relative sequence offsets because an absolute sequence does not exist prior to merging reads.

Building this graph would be similar to the previous exhaustive search with KMP, but vertices won't be merged.
In addition to KMP, hamming distance calculation would run M time (M = pattern). Therefore, building this graph
would take O(n^2(M(N+M)) time. n = number reads, N = avg "text" length, M = avg "pattern" length.

Once the graph is constructed, a merge process must be implemented where clusters of reads with minimal 
hamming distance (set by some arbitrary tolerance threshold) will be compared, and errors can be corrected
by consensus analysis. Single base-mutations would be simple to correct once identified. Repetitions/Deletions
could also be potentially identified at this point.......Magic programming would fix these.

.....I doubt the merging process can be accomplished in polynomial time.

         (a.k.a. The Siblinghood of the Traveling Sales-Pants)
             EC330 HW7 Q5 -- Adin Horovitz & Joshua Joseph 04/201/2015

Starting with a text document listing weighted, directed edges between ~1500
cities, this code plans a Minimish Hamiltoniesque Cycle, starting and ending at
city with code "ETCW." 

1) Read graph from text file (uses modified Trie to manage city names/pointers)
   
   --Instantiate one Node for each of the 1500 cities which contain:
   a) A pointer to the next city (initially NULL)
   b) Cost of that trip (weight of edge -- initially NULL)
   c) List of out-edges from that node (used to find min outEdge in step 2)
   d) Counter of how many times the city has been visited 

2) Plan (loosely) Minimum Cycle to span all cities 

   --Graph class contains data from step 1, and getMST() function, which:
   a) Starting from origin city, searches out-edge list for best destination
   b) Picks the lowest cost edge to an unvisited city
   c) Updates origin Node dest pointer and cost variable
   d) Updates destination Node's predecessor Node pointer
   e) Points "origin" pointer to destination Node
   f) Repeat a-e on new city until all cities have been visited once

3) Plan return trip to close Cycle

   --Seeks minimum path from final MST path back to origin city
   a) Searches through outEdge list for ECTW outEdge
   b) If none found, searches neighbor's outEdges (doesn't occur)

4) Output Cycle Edges and weights

   --Starting with origin Node, prints out-edge and weight. Then points
   "origin" pointer at next Node and repeats. Stops when last city has no 
   outEdge selected.
   --Similarly prints return Edges.
   --Outputs total Cost


SUMMARY: 1497 of 1497 cities visited
TOTAL COST = 98390
