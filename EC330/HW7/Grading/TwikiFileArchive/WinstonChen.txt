---++ Explanation

</VERBATIM>

b.  O (log(n^2 / 4)) - Since there is just a boolean flag to toggle the insert and keep track of the insert, then the flag will toggle which direction you insert the same key, left or right. But to get the location to insert is the height of the tree and go through each list of size m/2, which is O(log n^2 / 4)

c.O(n) - to get to the location of the insert is log(n) or height of the tree. Since we are using a linked list to keep track of the duplicate keys, the insert time is O(n)

d. O(n) simliar to the one in part b. The list is either on the x.left or x.right

</VERBATIM>


MST(V, E)
	set visitedVertices
	vector mst
	current vertex = start
	while(visitedVertices.size < number of V)
		push current vertex into a set of visited
		push back current vertex to mst
		for each e of the current vertex
			choose smallest edge of current vertex
			if the smallest weight edge != a visited vertex
				current vertex = smallest edge's vertex
			else if the smallest weight edge == a visited vertex
				go to previous vector in vector mst
				adjust current mst for new smallestedge
			else 
				choose next smallest weight edge of an unvisited vertex


---+++!! Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Descrbie and analyze your algorithm.
</VERBATIM>

The while loop looks at each vertices' edge. So on this step, before the if statements, the runnign time should be O(V+E). The most important step would be the else if statement, which back tracks to a previous vertex and adds in the new minimum weight edge. The worst care for every iteration of the wile look is another E --> O(V + E^2) --> O(E^2) in a dense graph.

---+ Problem 3.  Minimum Spanning Trees *[10 points]*
---++!! a
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

a. O(E). This algorithm takes an edge in the list. If it can remove the edge without disconnecting the graph, then the graph is still conected. It will remove the edge if the resulting T set of edges still contains a connected graph. This algorithm may not yeild a MST on every function call. Since this algorithm goes through each edge to chekc whether removing the edge still yeilds a connected graph, its running time is O(E)
---++!! b
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

No. This algorithm doesn't yield a MST, because it doesn't add an edge that may have a smaller weight to the current MST. 

there nodes, a,b,c

A--(4)--> B --(16)--> C --(5)-- >A, but according to the algorithm, the edge with weight 5 forms a cycle, so its not used and therefore, since 5 is smaller than 16, the algorithm doesnt yield a MST.
---++!! c
<VERBATIM>
Counterexample or Running time
</VERBATIM>

O(E*m), where m is the number edges it takes to find the largest edge to swap out.  This algorithm adds the edge of the set T. If the new set T contains a cycle, then it takes out the largest weight edge of the current set T.
---++!! Grader comments *[16/20]*
<VERBATIM>
First running time is O(E^2); last is O(E(V+E)).

vector<string> unused

merge(first, item)
	string answer 
	first.compare with item
	if first.compare with item has a match of > 3 characters
			merge(first, item)
		else 
			push item to unused
	if match found > half of 5
			merge the two strings with the [0,5/2] of item in front of first
			answer = merged strings
			first = answer
		else
			merge first to front of item
			answer = merged strings
			first = answer
	return answer

decode()
	vector<string> substrings
	for each substring
		push into substrings
	string answer 
	string first = substrings[0]
	for each item in substrings
		answer = merge(first, item)
	while !unused.empty
		for each item in unsused
			merge(answer, item)
	return item

The first for loop pushes all substrings in the vector --> theta(n)
the second for loop merges the first item wih all the other items in the vector - theta(n)
the while loop goes through the unused vector which is size m, which may be multiple times until the string is completed. theta(m)

Basically my algorithm takes in a substring and tries to find other substrings that could merge with. Those that cant merge with a skipped to be compared to later, when the merged substring is large enough to compare with. In the end, the sub string should "grow" into the correct string.

running time: theta(M + N)

Same as one above theta(m+n). Except this ignores substrings < 4, because I am assuming that the substring of a smaller size won't yield enough information to merge.

This algorithm just takes in N random size reads of the DNA, then in a double for loop, it tries to reconstruct the strand using the same merge function in the previous algorithms.

Running time theta(N^2) since it has to try to combine merges to make up for possible errors towards the end and random errors sprinkled thoughout

---+ Problem 5.  Traveling salesperson *[20 points]*
Provide a _short_ explanation of your approach here and the resulting cycle weight you found.

Also attach your code as =problem5.zip=, containing at least these files
   * =Makefile= :  running "make all" should compile your code to an executable =test=, which, when run, should produce your solution.
   * =result.txt= : the result file with one vertex name per line denoting the vertices of your cycle


I mostly preprocessed the graph by finding weights < 250 for and edge. From there I tried to go as far as I can without visiting a previously visited city, by using the smllest weight found from each city(Greedy approach). I was able to get through 974 cities, before I ran out of edges, since I delete the edges to visited cities. Then I did some post processing to find the remaining cities and their remaining  edges and from there I just did the same method of finding the next city with smallest weight. I was able to get all 1498 cities and return back to ETCW, which was my start.

I also attempted to go to each city by their smallest weight, but only deleting a visited edge. This way I can revisit the same city over and over again. This didn't work as I reach over 300k and visiting 1300 unique cities.
