theta(V + E)
---+++!! Brief explanation

Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>
You will look through the linked list and for every vertex you see, you will increment a counter for that vertex in another array. After going through the entire linked list, you will iterate through the array of vertices to see which one has the largest value. The first step will be theta(E) and the second step will be theta(V). Thus, the process as a whole will take theta(V + E)

theta(V) for c++11
tehta(V*E) for c++98
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>
The outer linked list just contains the vertices. To find the vertex with the largest degree, you must find the inner linked list with the largest number of elements. Thus, you will have to iterate through all the vertices to achieve this number. Also, since finding the size of a linked list is O(1) for c++11 and O(E) for c++98, this complete process will be theta(V) for c++11 and theta(V*E) for c++98.

theta(V^2)
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>
In order to find the vertex with the greatest degree, you must iterate though the outer vector and sum up the inner vectors to compare which index of the outer vector has the greatest sum. Finding the sum of an inner vector will be theta(V) and you must do this V times. Thus, this process will be on the order of theta(V^2)

	4         		Invalid runtime, should just be O( E)
	7         		In some cases, you will have O(V+E) which could be greater than O(V)

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.
</VERBATIM>

graph = variable name for adjacency in the form of vector of vectors
V = number of vertices

bool isBipartite(graph, V)
    int v_color[V]; // array of size V that will hold the colors of the vertices
    v_color[0] = 0;
    for int i from 0 to V
        if v_color[i] != NULL
            if any values of graph[i][ ] == (v_color[i] xor 1)
                return false
            else 
                all of values of v_color[graph[i][ ]] = v_color[i] xor 1
        else
            v_color[i] = 0
            all of values of v_color[graph[i][ ]] = v_color[i] xor 1
    return true



This will basically label each vertex with a certain color and will label neighbors will a second color. If the graph is not able to be colored with only two colors, then the graph is not bipartite. You can see this if two neighboring vertices have the same color. This will be theta(V) since you only need to color V vertices
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.
</VERBATIM>

graph = variable name for the graph in the form of an adjacency list (vector of vectors)
V = number of vertices

bool isCyclic(graph, V)
    make array v_colors of all zeros that will represent the color of the vertex
    for int i from 0 to V
        if v_color[i] == 0
            DFS_visit(graph, i)
    return false

bool DFS_visit(graph, vertex)
    set v_color[vertex] = 1
    for every element x in graph[vertex]
        if v_color[x] == 0
            DFS_visit(graph, x)
        if v_color[x] == 1
            return true;

This is basically a depth first search to find if the graph is cyclic

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
Provide a description of your approach here.  Upload your code online.

I set point values to every piece.
P = 1
B = 3
N = 3
R = 5
Q = 9
K = 1000
p = -1
b = -3
n = -3
r = -5
q = -9
k = -1000
I would make a separate board and play each possible move and calculate the board's points for each move. I would pick the move with the highest or lowest board point value based on which color I was
