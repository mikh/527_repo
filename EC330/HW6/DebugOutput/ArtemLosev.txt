---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<latex> \Theta(E) </latex>

---+++!! Brief explanation
It would take E time to detect the number of edges in couples in a way that would not repeat itself using linked lists. As in linked lists we iterate from the beginning to the end, it takes E time.

---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<latex> \Theta(V) </latex> 

---+++!! Brief explanation
Since the lists are sorted and each vertex has around a number of 2 edges, it would take a runtime of log(V) 

---++ c
---+++!! Running time

<latex>\Theta(1)</latex>

---+++!! Brief explanation

In an adjacency matrix, connections between vertices are represented with 1's and 0's. In order to reach the end of the matrix, it would be enough to enter the indeces of the desired value.

	10        		
	7         		In some cases, you will have O(V+E) which could be greater than O(V)
	0         		I'm not sure what you're trying to find here

---++ a
%CODE{"cpp"}%
// First of all, we would have to put all the elements of the vertices in an data structure and paint them with the same color.
// Once we list them all, we now need to check if the adjacent ones to see whether they have the same color with their neighbors. 
// We would have two colors: black(visited) and white (unvisited)
// We start by coloring all the vertices to white
 
biPartCheck(vertices, first) {
   integer colored[vertices];
   for ii=0 step 1 to vertices {
      colored[ii] = 0;
   }

   colored[first] = 1 // assigning black to first
   create stack s;
   s.push(first);

   while s is not empty, do {
      int black = s[first];
      pop the first element;

      for jj=1 step 1 to vertices {
         if colored[jj] == 0 {
            colored[jj] =  1 + s[black]
            s.push(jj);
         } else {
            return "not bipartite";
         }
      }
   }
   return "bipartite";
}

---++ b
%CODE{"cpp"}%
// Very similar to previous method, we can use a DFS algorithm recursively
dfs(vertex) { 
create stack s;
for ii=0 step 1 to vertices {
colored[ii] = 0;
}
S.push(vertex);
while S is not empty, do {
S.pop[ii];
if (not visited[ii]) {
visited[ii] = 1 ;
for neighbor = 1 step 1 to vertices {
S.push(neighbour);
