---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
The algorithm would go through the edge list incrementing counters every time a vertex is seen.  Therefore it would go through the list of edges once which is Theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V+E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In order to find the max degree of a vertex using an adjacency list we must search through every vertex and search through their individual lists.  We end up searching through every edge and every vertex therefore Theta(V+E)
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
The size of an adjacency matrix is V^2.  Since we must search through the whole matrix to find the max degree of a vertex, the algorithm would run in Theta(V^2) time.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
We can use BFS
queue q, any vertex x, graph G
q.enqueue(x)
while q is not empty
   h = q.dequeue()
   for each vertex v  in h's adjacent list
      if v.color = NULL
      v.color = (h.color == 1) ? 0 : 1
    	    q.enqueue(v)
      else if v.color == h.color
            NOT BIPARTITE
return bipartite    

</VERBATIM>
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
Using DFS
DetectCycle()
   for node in graph
     
      set all visited to false
      DetectCycle(n, n, visited)


DetectCycle(v,origin,visited)
   for every neighbor of v
      if neighbor == origin
         cycle is found
      if neighbor is not visited
       visited[neighbour] = true
       DetectCycle(neighbour, visited)
       visited[neighbour] = false

---+ Problem 4.  Simplified Chess *[30 points]*
---++ 4a
---+++ i.
<VERBATIM>
Look at attached picture of winning board.
</VERBATIM>
---+++ ii.  
<VERBATIM>
This is possible when Black is in check mate.  This can be seen in the example picture given on the assignment.  All moves for black still result in a loss.
