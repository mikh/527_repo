Provide your answer here.

Using a linked-list you have to start at the beginning of the array and iterate through to find any information
in the middle. Because you are using an edge list, the way to compute the maximum degree is to look
through the entire list and count the number of instances of each vertex. Looking through entire edge list 
of size E takes Theta(E) time.

<latex>\Theta(V + E)</latex>

---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.

In order to find the maximum degree of the graph, you have to look through both entire
linked lists. You have to check every vertex, of which there are V, and then check each 
linked list that is associated with the vertex of which there are 2E. Therefore Theta(V + 2E) =
Theta(V + E)

<latex>\Theta(V)</latex>

---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.

To find the maximum degree of the graph, you have to look at every vertex (V) and then look
at each associated vector and count the number of 1's. Size V vector with another size V vector
associated. Theta(2V) = Theta(V)

<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.
ASSUME:
V = number of vertices
Create an adjacency matrix (mat(V, V)) and set all connected vertices to 1.


int color[V];
for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i)
      color[i] = 0;

// Assign first color to source
color[0] = 1;
int count = 0;

queue <int> q;
q.push(0);
 
while q is not empty
{
     count++;
     int u = q.front();
     q.pop();
 
     // Find all non-colored adjacent vertices
     for int a = 0 to V
     {
            // An edge from u to v exists and destination v is not colored
            if mat[u][a] == 1 && color[a] == 0
            {
                // Assign alternate color to this adjacent v of u
                color[a] = 1;
                q.push(a);
            }
 
            //  An edge from u to v exists and destination v is colored with same color as adjacent u
            else if mat[u][a] == 1 && color[v] == color[u]
                  return false;
        }
    }
   
    // All vertices have been looked at and therefore there are no unconnected parts
    if count  = V
    {
          // If we reach here, then all adjacent vertices can be colored with alternate color
          return true;
    }
    else 
          // Two unconnected parts in one graph so not bipartite
          return false
}

Provide your pseudocode here.

Assume an Adjacency List which is constructed from two sorted arrays

DFS {
       color all Vertices white
       for each white vertex V
                  DFS_visit(V)

       // If all nodes have been visited
       return true
}

DFS_visit(V) {
       color V grey
       for each node n adjacent to V
               if n is white
                         DFS_visit(n)
               else if n is black                  // Can get to a processed node from node you're at now implies a cycle
                         return false
       color V black
}
