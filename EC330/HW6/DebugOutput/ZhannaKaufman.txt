Theta(V*E)

Provide your answer here.

An edge list is a list of the vertex endings of every edge. In order to find the degree of a vertex, 
one would need to look at every edge and see if the aforementioned vertex was one of the two 
values contained for that edge. This comparison would take Theta(1) time, so altogether this 
computation would take Theta(E) time. In order to find the maximum degree, one would need to 
do this for every vertex, and then compare. Comparison takes Theta(1) time, so altogether the 
complete computation would take Theta(V*E) time.

Theta(V*V)

Provide your answer here.


An adjacency list implemented as a linked list of linked lists would have each element in the
main linked list refer to a certain vertex, with the linked list that comprises the element consist of 
all of the neighbors of that vertex. A program would need to find the size of the neighbors list for each
vertex in the main linked list, and then compare them. The maximum size of a neighbors list is V-1, and 
so finding the size of each would take Theta(V) time. This would need to be done for the list pertaining 
to each vertex, taking Theta(V*V) time. Comparison would take Theta(1) time, so altogether the computation
should take Theta(V^2) time.

Theta(V*V)

---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.

Now, this is an adjacency matrix, so a computation would need to compare the vertices in either
the rows all columns. If columns are compared, all of the 1s in each column would need to be summed, and if 
it rows are being compared, all of the 1s in each row would need to be summed. These indicate how many 
vertices each vertex is connected to. Doing this sum would take Theta(V) time, and it would have to be done
V times for V vertices, so the complete computation would take Theta(V*V) time.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.

This algorithm is uses breadth-first-search through a queue to parse the graph.
For this algorithm, one color is assigned to a source node. Then, to 
each of its neighbors, a second color is assigned. Then, to each
neighbors' neighbors, the first color is assigned. If it is seen that 
one node shares another node of the same color, the graph is not
bipartite. The input to this graph is an adjacency matrix and a source
node.

bool Bipartite(int G[U][V], int src)
{
   //array to store colors
    int colorarray[V];

   //initialize color array
    for (i = 0 ; i< V;i++)
    {
    collorarray[i] = 0;
    }

    // Assign first color to source
    colorArr[src] = 1;
 
    // queue for breadth first search traversal
    queue <int> q;
   //start with source
    q.push(src);
 
    // while there are still vertices in queue
    while (!q.empty())
    {
        // take vertex element from queue
        int u = q.front();
       //pop element from queue (delete)
        q.pop();
 
         // find all 'blank' neighbors
        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
        {
            // if an edge from u to v exists and destination v is 'blank'
            if (G[u][v] && colorarray[v] == 0)
            {
                // assign an alternate color to v
                if (colorarray[u] == 1)
                        colorarray[v] = 2;
               else colorarray[v] = 1;
               // add vertex to queue so it can be checked in the same way
                q.push(v);
            }
 
            //  If an edge from u to v exists and they are both the same color
            else if (G[u][v] && colorarray[v] == colorarray[u])
                //the graph is not bipartite
                return false;
        }
    }
 
    // If the false condition was never experienced, the graph is bipartite
    return true;

Provide your pseudocode here.

I assume I will assume the graph for this problem is undirected.

This algorithm uses depth-first-search to parse the graph, traversing each branch of the graph
until a cycle is found.

The input to this function is an adjacency list implemented as an array of lists, and the number of 
vertices V. 

The function also keeps track of vertices that have already been visited.

The function iterates through the vertices of the graph (indices of the array containing adjacency
lists). For each vertex, it begins a recursive function. This recursive function looks at all of the vertices
in the adjacency list that share an edge with the main vertex. If a vertex has not been visited, then the 
function sets this vertex as the current vertex, the previous vertex as the 'parent', and begins to examine
the adjacent vertices in this vertex's adjacency list. If a vertex has been visited, then it looks to see whether
this vertex is the parent that the function is recursing from. If it is not, then we have come back to some original
vertex through a list.

//INITIALIZE ADJACENCY LIST 
// if V = the number of vertices
list<int> *adjlist; //array creating adjacency lists
adjlist = new list<int>[V]; //create as many adjacency lists as there are vertices

//add adjacent vertices into adjacency lists
for int(i=0; i<V; i++)
{
   adjlist[i].push_back(some number);
   adjlist[i].push_back(some other number);
   etc.
}

//recursive function run by main cycle function
bool IsaCycle(int v, bool visited[], int parent, list *adjlist);

//input adjacency list, and number of vertices
bool HasaCycle(list *adjlist, int V)
{
     //initialize array of "visited" nodes
     bool *visited = new bool[V];

    //mark all vertices as not visited
     for (int i=0; i<V; i++)
    {
    visited[i] = false;
    }

    //call function to traverse branch using Depth First search
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        //if the vertex has already been visited, do not traverse from here
        //it is obviously not part of a loop
        if (visited[i] == false)
          {
          //otherwise, begin recursion from this vertex to look for a cycle
          //recursive function defined after this one
          if (IsaCycle(u, visited, -1, adjlist))
             return true;
          }
    //if true has never been returned, there are no cycles
    return false;
}

//recursive function
bool IsaCycle(int v, bool visited[], int parent, list *adjlist)
{
    // Mark the current node as visited
    visited[v] = true;
 
    //Iterate through all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(adjlist[v]); i++)
    {
        //if an adjacent node is not visited, then recur for this adjacent
        if (!visited[adjlist[v][i]])
        {
           //set current node as parent
           //if next recurrence returns true, return true
           if (IsaCycle(adjlist[v][i], visited, v, adjlist))
              return true;
        }
 
        // If an adjacent vertex has been visited, and is not the vertex we are 
        //coming from, then there is a cycle
        else if (adjlist[v][i] != parent)
           return true;
    }
    //if no cycles have been found, and all nodes have been visited, then there are no cycles
    return false;
}

Provide a description of your approach here.  Upload your code online.

The analysis of this board was done via negamax, which works through the understanding that ta move of a certain value to one player in the game has the opposite value to their opponent. It was used to recursively analyze values for moves for each player and determine the move of the greatest value to the user - this was based on the value of pieces currently on the board. To make the algorithm more robust and gain the ability to see multiple moves ahead, alpha-beta pruning was used.
