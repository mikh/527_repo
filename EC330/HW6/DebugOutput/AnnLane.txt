---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
&Theta;( E )
---+++!! Brief explanation
Assuming we know the names of the vertices, we can create an array with the length of the number of vertices where each element is initialized to zero. I also keep a 'max_degree' variable which is initialized to 0. Then we traverse the linked list of edges (which takes E time to see all edges) and each time a vertex is encountered, the associated array element is incremented by 1. Accessing the array element and then incrementing it takes constant time. The just incremented elements are compared to the 'max_degree' variable and 'max_degree' is updated accordingly. Again, this is constant time. Once all edges have been visited, then 'max_degree' is returned. So the overall runtime depends on the number of edges.
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
&Theta;(E)
---+++!! Brief explanation
While the linked lists of linked lists must be traversed in order, it only needs to be traversed through each vertex's linked list of adjacent vertices. This is on the order of E nodes to traverse. Again, a max_degree variable is maintained and updated. So for each vertex, the number of adjacent vertices is counted and if it is higher then max_degree, then max_degree is updated. This operation takes constant time. So after &Theta;(E) nodes, the max_degree is determined. So runtime is &Theta;(E).
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
&Theta;(V^2)
---+++!! Brief explanation
The matrix will be V by V, or V^2 in size. The entire matrix must be traversed along each row and each of the V elements must be summed. The maximum degree can be stored in 'max_degree' and can be updated accordingly, which requires constant time. So summing V elements per V rows requires &Theta;(V^2)

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
Moves are made with some strategy. First, an random of the possible positions is initialized as the move to take so that I actually do some move. Then, I iterate through the possible positions resulting from the various moves. If making that move will capture one of the opponent's pieces, then the move to make is set to that quite desirable move. This is a simple, but offensive strategy.
