---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In order to determine the degree for a vertex is to go through the linked list
 and count the number of times that vertex appears in all the links, 
all of the links must be traversed. This would take Theta(E) time.
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V+E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In order to find the degree of a vertex using an adjacency-list implemented
as a linked-list of linked-lists, I would just traverse the first linked list to find the examining vertex
and then traverse its corresponding linked list and count how many links there are to determine the degree.
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In order to find the degree of a vertex using an adjacency matrix stored as a two-dimensional vector,
I would first use the vertex as one of the indices and going through the second index.
Incrementing through one axis of the vector would take Theta(v) time, while the size of the vector is Theta(v^2)

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
using the breadth first search
Assign red color to the source vertex, then color all the neighbors with BLUE color. Repeat it coloring it with red color.
Repeat this process. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex,
then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices, which basically means the graph is not Bipartite.
</VERBATIM>
%CODE{"cpp"}%
 int array
    for ( 0 to V)
        array[i] = -1;
    Assign first color to source
    Create FIFO of vertex numbers and enqueue source vertex for BFS traversal
    while ( q is not empty)
    {
        Dequeue a vertex from queue
        Find all non-colored adjacent vertices
        for (0 to  V)
        {
            if (An edge from u to v exists and destination v is not colored)
            {
                give toher color to this adjacent v of u
            }
 
              An edge from u to v exists and destination v is colored with
              same color as u
            else if (G[u][v] && colorArr[v] == colorArr[u])
                return false;
        }
    }
 
     If we reach here, then all adjacent vertices can be colored with the other color
    return true;
}
%ENDCODE%
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
Given graph gets stored in an adjacency matrix,
This can be implemented using various ways such as an array, 
vector or list of size (v^2). In order to index thru it, adjacency Matrix would be reasonable choice
</VERBATIM>
%CODE{"cpp"}%
int count = 0;
for (1 goto v)
{
    if (adj  matrix[1][i] == 1) 
        count++
    if (count == 2)
        return false;
}
return true;

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
<VERBATIM>
   The idea I came up behind the approach that I used to  solve this problem is that
   my program first captures any of the opponents pieces  (only those ones which a
   re in a position, that can be taken/killed by a player).The figures are ranked using
    a  number  system  so  it  could  figure  out  the  most valuable figures to capture
   ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value )
   For instance, between a bishop and a Rook, the program  decides to capture the 
   Rook rather than the bishop. Also the program is takes steps up in random order
   (using rand function), until  the moment where it finally detects another   compro-
   mised figure.
