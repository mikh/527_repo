---++ a
<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.
</VERBATIM>

start at any node and color it white

put s in queue

while queue not empty

x = pop(queue)

for every neighbor n of x{

	  if n isn’t colored{

		  color it the opposite color of x and put it in the queue.

	  } if n is colored and is the same color as x {

		  halt and output NOT BIPARTITE


}} output G IS BIPARTITE

---++ b
<VERBATIM>
Provide your pseudocode here.
</VERBATIM>

adjusted DFS:

color all vertices white

for each white vertex v {

	DFS-Visit(v)

}
——
DFS-Visit(v) {

	color v grey {

	if edge unexplored {

		for each node n adjacent to v {

			if n is white {

				DFS-Visit(n)

			} else {

				halt and output CYCLE FOUND

	} } } }color v black
