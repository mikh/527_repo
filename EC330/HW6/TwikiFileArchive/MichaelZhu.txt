---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
a(n)=big theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Because we don't know the maximum degree of a vertex until we've traversed the entire linked list. Since we're traversing edges, we have to go through the whole linked list, from pointer to pointer sequentially since we can't offset the indices as we would in an array. Therefore, adjacency time is big theta(E).
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
a(n) = big theta (V)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Adjacency time is big theta (V) because in the worst case, we have an unsorted linked list of linked lists. Each node in the linked list represents a vertex, which is the beginning of a sub-linked-list of neighboring vertices and hence gives the edges.

</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
a(n) = big theta (V)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Adjacency time is big theta (V) because in order to find the maximum degree, we have to either traverse all the rows or all the columns to add up the number of edges for each vertex.

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
Provide a description of your approach here.  Upload your code online.

To improve on the AI, we implement a very rudimentary strategy. Currently, the getMove method chooses a move in the movVect through the use of rand. Since the move is arbitrary, this leads to a very weak and harmless computer player. We would improve upon it by running a check on all possible movements and checking which of them will result in a capture if taken. We do this by iterating through the moveVect through the use of nthMove(i) where i is our iterator value in a for loop. 

We don't use moveVect[i] since this leads to a disastrous thread access error that crashes the program. Instead, we call nthMove because it has access to moveVect and is usable as it is a public member of chessBoard. This allows us to prevent the thread access error.

For each move in moveVect, we run an evaluation. We extract the 'to' value of the move and see if it is NOT an empty square. If it isn't, we then call a helper function called findRank which determines which enemy piece is present in the square. We return this ranking for the move and compare it to a running highestRank. If findRank > highestRank, we update the current i as the bestMove to make and set highestRank to the returned value. 

This ranking is based on the relative value system, attributing 1 point for a pawn, 3 for a knight or bishop, 5 for a rook, 9 for a queen, and 12 for a king. This ensures that what is passed into makeMove, if there are multiple moves that can be taken that result in a capture that turn, is the move that takes the most valuable piece. So we will always prioritize taking a queen over a pawn. This reduces the randomness element.

If there are no moves that result in a capture, we then resort to the randomness code.
