big Theta (E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In the case of edge list in order to find the maximum degree of a vertex we basically have to go through each edge list (each element on the list)
and find how many times a specific element(vertex) of an edge is repeated. then we just compare to see which vertex is repeated most times and this
will be the largest. We basically have to loop through all edges and find the number of vertices. (it takes constant time to see the elements of a single list)
therefore it is just Theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
big Theta(V+E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
For an andjancy list, it is easy to find the maximum degree of a vertex. We basically have to loop through the entire adjacecny list.
This happens because we will go through each vertex for each vertex we will have to look and count all the neighbours of that particular vertex.
By looking through all the neighbours we can can find the vertex that has the maximum number of neighbours which is basically the number of edges.
Therefore, we have to go through all vertices and find all edges connected to each vertice. This will take Theta(V+E)
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
For the matrix we basically have to go through all the elements of the matrix that is why it is Theta(V^2).
This is required because for example if we go row by row we will have to loop all the rows and find for each row
how many ones we have. Therefore, that means that for each row we do as many iterations as the number of columns.
but because columns and rows are the same thing in this matrix (both are the same vertices) then we basically have to loop through 
all the elements which will take Theta(V^2) time.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>

//the goal here is basically the following:
// I start with an element at a time and assign a "color" to the neighbouring elements
// i keep doing that until the end
//afte I check if the assgined colors have any conflict from one loop to another
//if they do then graph is not bipartite

int vertexnum; // number of vertices
int edgenum; //number of edges
int part[SOME BIG NUMBER];  //like 1000  this is a partition
int visited[SOME BIG NUMBER]; //like 1000 here are the visited elements

vector<int> matrix[SOME BIG NUMBER]; //this is an adjacency matrix (helps to make algorithm run in linear time)

bool mybfs(int begin)
{
    int start,end;
    queue <int> myqueu; //is a queue structure that contains the vertices
    myqueu.push(begin);
    part[begin] = 1; //1 left
    visited[begin] =1; //set my matrix
    
    while(myqueue is NOT empty)
    {
        start = myqueu.front();
        myqueu.pop();
        
        for(i=0; i<size of matrix[start]; i++)
        {
            end = matrix[start][i];
            if (part[start] == part[end])
                return false;
            
            if (visited[end] == 0)
            {
                visited[end] = 1;
                part[end] = 3 - part[start] //this changes 1 and 2 subsets
                myqueue.push(end);
            }
            
        }
 
    }
    
    return true;
}


//the above function is a version of bfs algorithm
//it basically goes through the elements and assings "colors" (0 and 1) to the elements


bool chechbipartite()
{
    for(i=0 i<vertexnum; i++)
    {
        if (visited[i]==0 && mybfs(i) == false)
            return false;
        
    }
    
    return true;
    
}


//so here we are doing all the work.

// in order to implement the algorithm above we have to call these two functions with
//a given graph.

// for example:

int main()
{
    for(i=0; edgenum; i++)
    {
        get origin and destination of given graph
        
        matrix[origin].push_back(destination);
        matrix[destination].push_back(origin);
        
        //so now chech if it is bipartite
        if(mybfs is true)
        {
            // IT IS BIPARTITE
        }
        
    }
    
    
    
}

//represent graph as an adjacecny list
//if we assume that the graph is already stored in an adjacecny list it is ok
// if not then the following has to be done:

//add graph into adjacency list
//use a similar approach with problem4a
class Graph
{
    int V;    //vertices
    list<int> *adj;    // Pointer to the array that contains the adjacecny lists

public:
    Graph(int V);  
    void addEdge(int v, int w);  

};
 
Graph::Graph(int V)
{
    this->V = V;
    adj = new list<int>[V];
}
 
void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w)
{
    adj[v].push_back(w); 
    adj[w].push_back(v); 
}



//I did it as an object because it is easier conceputally and it made more sense to me after doing problem4a
// Bellow is where the actual algorithm will be implmented (to find if it has any cycle)

int main()
{
   MYadjlist; // the list that contains every vertex and the conecting verrtices to it
   

   for(i=0; i<number of vertices; i++)
  {

 int mysize = MYadjlist[i].size();  //finds number of edges for vertex i
 
 mysize = mysize/2;  //divides it by two
        if(mysize < number of vertices  - 1  && mysize !=0)
         {  ACYCLIC  }
        else    //have to check one more case here
       {
                   if(mysize==0)                                        //if a vertex is completely unconnected (by itself)
                    {                                                           //it will make this algorithm not work so,
                          if(mysize < number of vertices -2)      //subtract one more because now I wont have v-1 edges                                               
                             {ACYCLIC}
                        
                          else
                           { THERE IS AT LEAST A CYCLE }
                    }

       } 

  }


 }


Here is a small summary of my algorithm
stores grapgh as adjancy list
for i=0  to V-1 and take the size of inner array to get how many edges it is connected
divide it by 2
if that is less than V-1 is acyclic
else cycle

however special case:
if size is 0 (for some i) then it is special case and I have to subtract 1 from V because I know that for that particular vertex i, there is no other vertex connected to it.


this algorithms also runs in O(V) because we are looping through all the vertices (V time) and we are getting the size of each element of the adj list.
Taking the size runs in constant time and it gives us all the information we want (number of edges for that particular vertex)

Attach your solutions to this topic.
---++ 3b.
Attach your solutions to this topic.


I have also attached a txt file with the output on my problem3b.zip file.

Note:
The coloring does not matter for this problem so I just picked a color of 5 for all vertices
 (although this is against to the coloring rule (that two connected vertices cannot have the same color) )
We were told though that coloring does not matter for this problem.

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
I was not able to make my code work, so I am going to give here an explanation of my approach:

So for this problem my idea was to create a huge graph which contains for every single piece(vertices) all the possible moves(edges).
 Each branch/edge of this graph will basically lead the board to a different arrangement of pieces which will then be examined again
as a new case/graph that all the vertices(pieces) are connected to edges(all posiible moves)

Basically, the idea was that I have a tree that the nodes are specific positions on the chessboard and they are connected to all the
other possible possitions that the board can take (always according to the pieces' possible moves)

The my approach is the following:
This tree eventually leads to a result someone wins (either king is off or king has no moves)
Therefore, I go to the end of the tree (there are thousands of possible arrangement on the board that can make me win, I will discuss this in a second)
and I get an arrangement that wins. Then I go back a step and find a position close to my current one. Then afain the same thing until I get to my current position.
If that happens then I know exactly the path to victory.

However, as I mentioned above, the posibilites are thousands. The goal is to try to discard some cases (Basically isolate parts of the grapgh/tree and use only
the ones that are related to the current position, and not go through all the possible cases)
This applies for every step/level of the tree and therefore I am saving a lot of time and space.

In addition, I havent uploaded any code because I was not able to figure out how to implement exactly my idea, and it wouldnt actually work.
So, above is the approach that I tried to implement
