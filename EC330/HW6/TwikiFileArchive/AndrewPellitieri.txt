\theta (E)
</latex>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Make a temp counter int array of size V, with each element initialized to zero.  
Go through each edge list element and increment the temp counter for each of the two named vertices.  
At the beginning you should also declare a maxDegree = 0 temp variable.  
Say you get to edge {a,b} in the edge list, increment the array counter for a, then for b, then check that the a counter and the b counter are < max.  
If one of them are > than max, replace max with degree count value in that array holder.

<latex>
\theta (V^2)
</latex>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Breif Explain:
Worst case is a complete graph where the # of edges in each row is (V-1), in linked list it takes V time for access to row 
(row being another linked list) so complexity comes to V^2

Implementation
Have an int array of counters initialized to 0 for size V.  
Go through the list of vertices in the adjacency list and increment the counter array corresponding
to each vertexID once for each neighbor(to count), aka so long as the secondary neighbor array/list
is != NULL or end() go through and increment for each neighbor.
Compare this count to the temp variable maxDegree declared at the beginning and assigned to 0.
If maxDegree is smaller than the counter for any vertex, set maxDegree = to that value
return maxDegree

---+++!! Running time
<latex>
\theta (V^2)
</latex>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Similar to the previous implementations iterate through each row totaling the 1's as the degree count.
at the end of each row when total is reached compare to max, sub in as necessary, and return max at end.

//Method for this part was to use graph coloring to check if any edges and color all connected 
//vertices oposite colors, as soon as we hit a visited vertex that is colored same as the one
//we are currently operating on we return false as it violates bipartiteness
// collab with Max Li, resources used: ece.northwestern.edu slides 
//Assuming graph input is a 2d array and an origin

bool bipartiteCheck(G[ ][V], origin)      // takes 2d array, and the origin node
{
  int colorArr[V]

  for i = 0 to V        // -1 represents no color at that node, 0 represents the first color, and 1 represents the second color
    colorArr[i] = -1

  colorArr[origin] = 0          // set the origin node to be the first color
  vector temp;         // make a vector, name it temp
  temp.push_back(origin)         // insert the origin node into the vector

  while(temp isn't empty)         // run the while loop while the temp vector isn't empty
  {
    int u = temp.front()       // set a local variable to be the front of the vector
    delete first element of the vector

    for j = 0 to V                                 //go through and find all adjacent vertices that exist
    {
      if (G[u][j] and colorArr[j] == -1)      // checks to see if the node is colored
      {
        colorArr[j] = 1 - colorArr[u]       // if it's not colored, then color it the opposite color of the previous node
        temp.push_back(j)                                          //add j to the end vector
      }
      else if (G[u][j] and colorArr[j] == colorArr[u])     // checks to see if this node is the same color as the previous node
      {
        return false;     //since the node was the same color as the previous node, return false, becasue the graph is not bipartite 
      }
    }
  }

  return true;   //if it makes it here, that means it went through every node, and colored every node the alternate color of the previous node. this means the graph is bipartite
}

---++ b
<VERBATIM>
// so use a depth first search, and look for back edges
// the complexity is O(V) because we look through only the vertices and see if there is a backedge. If none of them have a backedge, then we know that it does not contain a cycle
bool containsCycle(G , origin )   // pass in a graph, and the origin point
{
  stack s;       // start with an empty stack
  for each vertex leaf v     // look at the leafs only, because those are the only cycles that
     visited(v) is false;      // haven't visited any vertices
     s. push(v);           // add v to the stack
  while(s isn't empty)   //run the while loop while s isn't empty
  {
    s. pop(v)
    if (visited(v) and not connected to ancestor)    // looks to see if any leaf is connected to a previous one. if not, then we continue looking.
         continue
    else    // if there is a backedge, then that means it is a cycle. once there is a cycle, then automatically means graph contains a cycle, so we can say false
         return false
  }
  return true;   //if it makes it here, that means there were no backedges, and so it doesn't contain a cycle, in which case we would return true

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
I was able to do a minimax approach, look at my potential moves and have a potential gain, then look at opponents values and project that as a loss.  With this method I was able to consistently beat random player and even occasionally beat player #2.  I tried to add layers to it, checking 3 or 4 layers in advance and thus constructing multiple board models, these began to time out though due to the large workload.  Then I looked at trying to "prune" some of these options but could not get it to ever beat 2 or 3 consistently.

I spent about 15 hours on this and am not sure which code to include. so I included a functioning version that does fairly well against 1/2, and then another version that also works but not as well but has the work for my more elaborate/deep versions commented out.

I also did some tricky stuff with the way I force a move if a kind could be taken.
