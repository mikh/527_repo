---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
\Theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
For each edge, note which vertex it points to and add 1 to a counter counting how many times the pointer is used.
Then find the maximum value out of all of the pointers.
This will take at least time E, including some time to calculate the maximum pointer value.
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
\Theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
For each linked list, count the amount of links in the linked list (not the amount of elements).
Store the largest value.
This will take time V^2, since the upper bound is the maximum number of edges for a vertex, V.
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
\Theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Iterate over the two-dimensional vector, adding 1 whenever a 1 is found in a one-dimensional vector to another vector.
Then find the maximum value of all of them.
Since a two-dimensional vector has V^2 edges, this has complexity (V^2).

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
Use a depth-first search of the graph. Start at a vertex and mark it with color 1. 
For each edge of the vertex, travel to the vertex along that edge and mark it with color 2.
Then travel to a vertex along an edge connecting to the second vertex and mark it with color 1, and then repeat until 
all vertices are marked with alternating colors.
If two colored vertices are connected by an edge, check if the color is the same. If so, return false.
Otherwise, iterate through the entire graph and return true if no two identically-colored vertices are connected by an edge.
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
Use a depth-first search of the graph.
Each vector visited is colored to color 1.
If depth-first search reaches another vertex of color 1,
return true.
Otherwise, return false.

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
My algorithm was created with a focus on defense: it identifies how in any way the king can possibly be in check and then takes steps to block or dodge it.

Otherwise, its moves are mostly random, apart from attempting to take the highest-value piece whenever it is available.

If given a choice between taking the Queen and avoiding check from a bishop, it'll dodge the bishop. If given the choice between taking the King and avoiding check, it'll take the King, since that is the victory condition.
