---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
&Theta;(V+E)
---+++!! Brief explanation

Go through the linked list of edges and increment a counter for each vertex every time it appears. (This requires &Theta; (E) time)

The counters can be stored in an array, and then you can find the max of the array (This requires &Theta; (V) time)

Total run time is &Theta;(V+E)
---++ b
---+++!! Running time

&Theta;(V*E)

Note: Could be &Theta;(E) if using C++11
---+++!! Brief explanation

If you were to put all of the vertices into a linked list of linked list, you would wind up with V sub linked lists of linked lists. Each of these V linked lists would have a maximum of E elements. To find the vertex with the highest degree, we would need to go through each of the linked lists and find the one with the biggest size. According to the C++ library, finding the size of a linked list is linear run time for C++98. This means that in the worst case, we have to loop through V * E elements.
---++ c
---+++!! Running time

&Theta;(V<sup>2</sup>)

---+++!! Brief explanation
If you were to make an adjacency list into a 2D matrix, the matrix would have the size V * V. This means that there are a total of V<sup>2</sup> elements. In order to find the vertex with the highest degree you would go row by row in the matrix and count the number of adjacencies in the V columns. If you repeat this for each of the V rows, you wind up with V<sup>2</sup> run time.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
Use a greedy coloring algorithm

<verbatim>
Coloring_Method(Graph)
       Pick a starting vertex V and color it grey. Color all other vertices white
       Put V into a queue, Q
       
       while Q is not empty
       {
           H = head (Q)
           for every neighbor N of H
           {
               if N is white 
                   color it grey and put into queue
               else if N is black
                   return Graph is NOT bipartite
           }
           Color H black
           Pop H from Q
       }
       return Graph is Bipartite.
</verbatim>

Use BFS greedy coloring method. First, color a starting node and put it into queue. Look at neighboring nodes, color them a different color, and put them into queue. If you get a neighbor that is already the same color as it's parent, return not bipartite. If you get through the whole graph without hitting this exception, it is bipartite.
---++ b
Use DFS to find cycle

<VERBATIM>
DFS
    Color all vertexes white
    For each white vertex V
    DFS_Visit(V)

DFS-Visit(V):
        Color V grey
        For each neighbor N of V
        {
            if (N == white)
                DFS-Visit(N)
            else
                return Cycle Found
        }
        Color V black
</VERBATIM>

This code uses the DFS method. It goes through each node and looks for a node that is adjacent to it that is previously colored grey. If the node has no cycle, the code should only go through each vertex once. If the code has a cycle, It will find a loop before reaching the last vertex.

Black's King is trapped in the corner, and none of Black's pawns can move, so there are no valid moves
---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]

Chess engine plays aggressively. It looks for any move it can make where it can take an opposing piece. If it does not find a move where it can take an opposing piece, it moves randomly

Always beats random player, usually beats smarter player, loses to smartest player
