O(|E||V|)

Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>

We need an outer loop :for Vertex in Vertex_list. And an inner loop for Edge in Edge_list. Then we check if Vertex is present in Edge, and find the degree for each vertex.

The two loops give us O(|E||V|)

O(|V|+|E|)

---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>

We loop over the linked list of all the vertices. This take O(V) time. 

We find the length of each linked list within the outer linked list. Assume that the length of this inner linked list is n. Finding the length of the linked list takes n time.

The maximum length for the longest linked lists is n, the maximum length for the second longest linked lists is (n-1) and so on, because once a edge is mentioned for any of of the vertex, the same edge can not be mentioned for the other vertex. These add up to |E|

This takes O(V). Hence the total time taken is O(|V|+|E|).

O(|V|^2)
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Provide your answer here.
</VERBATIM>

First we need to create an outer loop  which loops through the list which contains our vertices. Using this we can find the index of the vertex in our adjacency matrix. This take O(V) time. Then we need an inner loop for each vertex, and check the number of 1's in the vector. This takes O(V) time. The total time is O(V^2).
