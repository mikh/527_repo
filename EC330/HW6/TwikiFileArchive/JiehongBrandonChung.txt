---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
</VERBATIM>
&#952;(E)
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Looping through each edge and keeping track of how many times a vertex appears will take E time because the linked list has to go through each edge once to see all the vertices.
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
O(V + E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
It will take at most V time to get to the vertex you want the degree of, then it will take at most E time to get how many neighbors it has.
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
</VERBATIM>
&#952;(V)
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
It takes constant time to get to the target vertex, then checking all V vertices for any given vertex in order to get the degree will take V time.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
//for a graph represented by adjacency list implemented with vector< vector<int> >, runs in O(V + E) time
isBipartite(graph G)
for each vertex in G
    for each adjacent vertex
        if color of adjacent vertex = color of this vertex
            return false
return true
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
//for a graph represented by adjacency list implemented with vector< vector<int> >, runs in O(V) time
dfs_visit(v)
    //if the vertex is already black it has already been visited so there is a cycle
    if v black
        return true
    color v gray
    for each node n adjacent to v
         if n white
            dfs_visit(n)
    color v black

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
I used a standard minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, and my evaluation fuction was based on the symmetric evaluation function created by Claude Shannon in 1949. This function <br/>
can be found at https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Evaluation: <br/>
%CODE{"cpp"}%
f(p) = 200(K-K')
       + 9(Q-Q')
       + 5(R-R')
       + 3(B-B' + N-N')
       + 1(P-P')
       - 0.5(D-D' + S-S' + I-I')
       + 0.1(M-M') + ...

KQRBNP = number of kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns
D,S,I = doubled, blocked and isolated pawns
M = Mobility (the number of legal moves)
%ENDCODE%
It basically assigns a numerical value to the attributes described in the blockquote above. I modified it to exclude the special pawn conditions and the number of legal moves to account for <br/>
the change in rules for the assignment and to improve runtime, at the sacrifice of accuracy to this formula. I only call my minimax function to 2 levels deep, because otherwise it takes too long.
