<VERBATIM>
theta(E) 
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Each vertex will have a value represented as an integer. These values are not known yet, but they exist. 
For an example, each vertex will be an integer. 
Create a vector of ints. The vertex values will be the key and the number of vertexes present will be the value. 
Create an integer to represent the maximum degree and set it as 0. 
Iterate through the edges, increment value at the vertex value. Check if this value is greater than max degree, if so, overwrite max degree as the value. (E time)
Return the greatest max degree.

---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
theta(V)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Iterate through the list of lists. Create an integer to represent the maximum degree. 
For the first sublist vertex, store the vertex it represents and the size of the sublist.  
Then for each sublist, measure the size, and if greater than the maximum degree, 
overwrite the maximum degree with the size. Return the maximum degree.
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
theta(V^2) 
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
A two dimensional vector will be implemented as a vector of vectors. 
Create an integer to represent the maximum degree and set it as 0. 
Sum the values in each row of the matrix storing by summing the values of subvector_ii[ jj ] 
and incrementing jj to V or the end of the row. If this is greater than the maximum degree than 
overwrite the maximum degree with this value. (V each V so V^2 time)
If this is a directed graph you will also have to check the sum of each column. 
Use accumulate(vector.begin(),vector.end(),0) on each subvector.  
If this is greater than maximum degree than overwrite the maximum degree with this value. (V each V so V^2 time) 
Return the maximum degree.

struct Node
{
	int color = NULL;	  //color of the node 
	list<Node> adjacency; 	//each node adjacent to this node will be in this list 
}

queue<Node> Graph; 	//this is filled with the nodes of the graph


bool CheckBipartite(list<Node> Graph)  //true if bipartite; false if not bipartite
{
	Graph[0].color = 1 	//color one is blue; color two will be red
	queue<Node> GraphCopy = Graph  //this is so you don't alter the Graph by running bool check. 
                                                                  //could also pass by reference or something

		if popped.color = null
			if popped.adjacency.size = 0
				popped.color = 1
			else
				for adj in popped.adjacency
					if all adjacency colors are the same
						popped.color = !popped.adj[0].color
		else
			for every node adj in popped.adjacency  	//neighbors
				if adj.color= NULL
					adj.color = !popped.color
				if adj.color = popped.color
					return FALSE  	//a neighbor is the same color and 									//therefore the graph is not bipartite
	}
	return TRUE	//No same color neighbors are found and therefore the graph is bipartite. 
	
}

// Run time is same as BFS which is O(V+E) since constant time work is done V times 
//to put things in/out of the queue. Constant time work is done for comparing the neighboring colors 2E times.

// A depth first search with a check that adjacent nodes have been visited before will tell us if the graph is a cycle. If this check succeeds, it is a cycle.

struct node
{
     bool visited = false;     //false until visited, then becomes true. 
     list<node> adjacencyList;    //each node adjacent to this node will be in this list 
}

map<node> Graph //the graph in question
stack<node> Stack
Stack[0] = Graph[0]

bool CycleCheck(stack<node> Stack)  //returns true if a cycle is found
{
     current = pop(Stack)
     current.visited = true
     while Stack not empty
     {
          for adj in current.adjacencyList
          {
               if adj.visited = true
                     return true
               Stack.push(adj)
          }
     }
     for vertex in Graph  // go through the graph from beginning until end or in this case it finds something not visited
         if !vertex.visited 
              Stack[0] = Graph[vertex] //stack is filled with new unseen vertex
              CycleCheck(Stack)
}

// This is O(V) time, because for each unvisited vertex to the stack, a constant amount of 
//  work is done to check that it has no previously visited neighbors.

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
Each type of piece is assigned a value: pawn, 1; bishop, 3; knight, 3; 
rook, 5; queen, 9; king, 10000. 
If a piece is taken, the score goes up by the value of the piece. 
If a piece is lost, the score goes down by the value of the piece. 
Score is originally set to 0. Every possible move is scored and if there 
is a move with a higher score than seen before, this move is chosen 
on a test board and every move on this board is evaluated. if the score 
is less than the score before, meaning a more valuable piece is potentially 
lost, this move has this as the final score. Basically it looks for moves 
where you take valuable pieces but do not lose valuable pieces. 
The move with the highest score is chosen. 
If there is no move with a high score, a random move is selected. 
This is not properly implemented. Random moves are usually selected.
