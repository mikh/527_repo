---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Big Theta(E) 
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
This would take E time to detect the number of edges in couples in a way that would not repeat itself using linked lists. As in linked lists we iterate from the beginning to the end, it takes E time. </VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Big Theta(V) 
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Since the lists are sorted, and each vertex has around a number of 2 edges, it would take a runtime of lg(V) 
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
Big Theta(1)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
In an adjacency matrix, connections between vertices are represented with 1's and 0's. In order to reach the end of the matrix, it would be enough to enter the indeces of the desired value.

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>


// First of all, we would have to put all the elements of the vertices in an data structure and paint them with the same brush. Once we list them all, we now need to check if the adjacent ones to see whether they have the same color with their neighbors. 

// We would have two colors: black(visited) and white (unvisited)

// We can start off by coloring all the colors to white
 
biPartCheck(vertices, first)

	integer colored[vertices];
	for ii=0 step 1 to vertices 
		colored[ii] = 0;
	end for

	colored[first] = 1 // assigning black to first
	create stack s;
	s.push(first);

	while s is not empty, do
		int black = s[first];
		pop the first element;

		for jj=1 step 1 to vertices 
			if colored[jj] == 0 then 
				colored[jj] =  1 + s[black]
				s.push(jj);
			end if
			else
				not bipartite
		end for
	end while

	bipartite

end biPartCheck


</VERBATIM>
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
// Very similar to previous method, we can use a DFS algorithm recursively

dfs(vertex)  
         create stack s;
         for ii=0 step 1 to vertices 
		colored[ii] = 0;
	end for

        S.push(vertex);
         while S is not empty, do
            S.pop[ii];
            if (not visited[ii]) then
               visited[ii] = 1;
               for neighbor = 1 step 1 to vertices 
                  S.push(neighbour);
               end for
            end if
         end while
end dfs()
