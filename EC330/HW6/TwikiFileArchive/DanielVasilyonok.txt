---+ Problem 1. Representations. *[30 points]*
---++ a
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
theta(E)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
Because it is a edge-list, each node in the linked list represents one edge. At each node, you can increment a counter for the degree of the vertex on each 
side of the edge. Once you've looked through the whole linked-list once, the vertex with the highest degree is the one with the highest count. Looking through
the linked-list once take theta(E) time.
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
theta(V)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
The adjacency list stores V vertices, and at each vertex you can obtain the size of the linked list in constant time. The size of the linked list is the degree at that vertex. The
max degree can be continuously reset until the end is reached, which will take V time.
</VERBATIM>
---++ c
---+++!! Running time
<VERBATIM>
theta(V^2)
</VERBATIM>
---+++!! Brief explanation
<VERBATIM>
every vertex V could potentially be connected to another vertex V, so for every V we have to check V, meaning 
the running time is theta(V^2)

---+ Problem 2.  Graph algorithms *[20 points]*
---++ a
<VERBATIM>
Start at any node V, color blue, put V in a queue. 
While(Q not empty)
U = pop(Queue)
for every neighbor n of U
     if(n isn't colored)
         color opposite of U
         put in queue
     if(n is colored same as U)
         return false
return true

//data structures: graph represented as adjacency list implented as linked list of linked lists, and queue
//This will allow the algorithm to take linear time theta(V+E) to go through all 
//verticies. 
</VERBATIM>
---++ b
<VERBATIM>
vector graph;
graph[i]= set seti; // graph[i] corresponds to the i-th vertex; it holds seti, 
populated with with all the graphs's indexes, that correspond to vertices directly connected to the "i" vertex.
If vertex from graph[2]. directly connected to vertices from graph [3], [6], [7], then the graph[2] set will hold { 3, 6, 7 };
We can think of seti as the edges set for i-th vertex, i.e. for i=2, edges are 2-3, 2-6, 2-7.
We'll design a graph traversal procedure, using the information in the "graph" vector. 
The procedure would try to build the longest path first, i.e. Depth First. 
The procedure would use each edge only, once when building the traversal path.
Suppose, we're using the edge 2-3, from graph[2] set. Then we would erase the element "2" from graph[2] set, and the element [2] from
the graph[3] set.
Our procedure will use a stack, "stack path" to push onto this stack each sequential i-vertex onto the stack.
If we are unable to increase the length of the path from the current i positon, then we would pop the i from the stack.
Alongside stack, we'll use a set, "set used". Every push(i) onto the path stack will be followed by used.insert(i) into the set.
Every time before path.push(i) we'll find out if the element is already in the "used" set, i.e. already in the "path".
If the element is on the "path" already, the procedure would stop, because the cycle is found.
Otherwise, the procedure would continue, until the path is finished without cycles, i.e. there is nothing to pop from the "path".

It could be that the graph is made up of several disconnected components, and our traversal procedure answer the cycle question 
only about one of the components.

So, after the traversal procedure returned with no cycles found, then we'll check if all graph[i] sets are empty, and therefore all the
edges are used up. Suppose, there graph[i] is not empty. Then we'll try to traverse this graph component starting from the i-vertex.

//graph represented as adjacency list, ~ theta(V) time

---++ 4b.  Main task [20 points]
I would create a graph, with each vertex representing a state in the game, and each edge representing a move to a vertex. Each state will have a value based on how good
that move is. The score of each player will be held as an int and it will be calculated by the the current pieces it has, and the board position.
The values given to each piece will be as such: (based on standard valuations) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value
pawn: 1
knight: 3
bishop: 3
rook: 5
queen: 9
king: 100
Also, each row on the board will have a value. Values towards the center will have higher point values because a player is in a better state if they have control of the 
board in the center. The column values will be as such:
a:1 b:2 c:3 d:4 e:4 f:3 g:2 h:1
