---++ Problem 1 *[Strange Sorting, 25 points]*

---+++ 1a
---++++ !!Result
<VERBATIM>
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Correctly sort
<VERBATIM>
No
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Explanation & running time OR counterexample
<VERBATIM>
For example, the array [4,3,2,1,0,9,8,7,6,5] gets sorted to be [4,3,2,1,0,5,8,7,6,9]. 
On the first scan, when ii=5, jj iterates from 4 to 9 (10/2 = 5, so it reads indexes 0 through 5). 
5 and 9 get swapped. For the rest of the iterations, however, each of the iis are always greater
 than all of the jjs. The upper and lower half each are never sorted relative to themselves, only to each other. 
</VERBATIM>

---+++ 1b
---++++ !!Result
<VERBATIM>
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Correctly sort
<VERBATIM>
Yes.
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Explanation & running time OR counterexample
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm should work for any array, since it will always find the smallest element in a partition 
and move that to the front, then re-partition the rest and repeat. This has the effect of searching out
the first smallest, then second smallest and so on.

Worst case running time is O(n^2). T(n) = n + T(n-1) where n is from the for loop, and T(n-1) from the recursion.
</VERBATIM>

---+++ 1c
---++++ !!Result
<VERBATIM>
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Correctly sort
<VERBATIM>
Yes.
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Explanation & running time OR counterexample
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm should work for any array by bubbling the numbers into order by the
three biggest at a time. After one iteration from j=0 to n-4, the three largest numbers
 are sorted into place, the next iteration places the next three largest, and so on. 
Though the intermediate sorts sometimes shuffle numbers out of order, the elements
 are traversed enough times (due to the outer for) that everything gets shuffled into place.

The worst case running time is O(n^2), resulting from the nested for loop structure. 
While BubbleSort has a worst case running time proportional to n^2, it only factors 
into this algorithm as a constant, since it is always being run on four elements.

---++ Problem 2 *[Special-case sorting, 20 points]*
Provide _and analyze_ the most efficient algorithm you can for sorting an array of =n= items of the following type:
---+++ a. Integers in the range -%PHI% to %PHI% (inclusive).
---++++ !!Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
In terms of running time alone, doing a modified counting sort would provide the fastest result,
 since counting sort is linear. The algorithm I propose would first scan over the array to shift all 
negative values - in no particular order - to the left of the leftmost positive value (keeping the 
index of that value so that the array can be partitioned). Then a greatest to least counting sort 
would be done on the absolute values of the negative partition, and a least to greatest counting
 sort would be done on the positive partition. These two partitions could then be joined back together 
without comparison, since they were each previously partitioned based on relationship to 0. There are
 some severe memory drawbacks to this, though, which would make this less efficient overall than a 
function which took longer time, but had n < 2*78010167. 

If memory is a consideration, then doing mergeSort on the array would probably be the best of both worlds,
since mergeSort has one of the fastest average times of all of the comparison based sorts, and has a better
worst time than quickSort. It also would take much less space than doing a counting sort. Even though the range
of potential values is very large, a standard mergeSort would work here:

mergeSort(int inArray[ ], int n)
     left[ ] = inArray[0...n/2]
     right[ ] = inArray[n/2+1...n-1]

     left = mergeSort(left, n/2)
     right = mergeSort(right, n/2)

     merge(left,right)

</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Each of the components of the modified counting sort method described would take
 time proportional to n (scanning n items in an array, joining two arrays with n total elements).
 Counting sort itself is known to take Theta(n+m) time, where m = 78010167 in this case.
 So overall the time is proportional to n. However, the space would be proportional to m,
 and we'd need to have two arrays of 78010167 elements each. That would be a lot 

MergeSort is known to take Theta(nlogn) time at best, worst, and average. This doesn't
 beat the time of counting sort, but the space requirement would be approximately O(n), 
which would be better than that of counting sort as long as n was less than 2*78010167. 
If n was much larger, than counting sort would be the much better choice.
</VERBATIM>

---+++ b. Strings of n^{ %CALCULATE{$EVAL(1000 + $MOD(%PHI%,2000))}% } - 1</latex> characters.
---++++ !!Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Radix sort would be the most effective algorithm here, since (non-extended) ASCII 
strings are analogous to numbers in base 128. Radix sort lends itself especially well
to the sorting of large numbers with an equal amount of digits in each, so the algorithm 
would behave optimally for this application. In this case, we have n strings of 1167 characters,
each with 128 possible values. In light pseudocode:

radixSort(string arrayA[ ], int n)
     for i = 0 to 1167-1     // iterate through each char of the string, assuming char 0 is rightmost
          countingSort arrayA elements[0...n-1] on char i

Using a stable sort on the digits is important to correctly sorting the entire array overall. Stable sorting
preserves the work done to sort previous digits. Such a stable sort would require a little bit of memory
so that it could remember the original order of strings with the same char value in the same column
(a linked list could be used).
</VERBATIM>

---++++ !!Analysis
<VERBATIM>
Radix sort is known to take Theta(k(n+d) time when the underlying stable sort
 takes Theta(n+k) times (as counting sort does), so this would take
Theta(1167(n+128)) time, i.e. Theta(n).

---++ Problem 3 *[Constrained sorting, 25 points]*
---+++ Pseudocode
<VERBATIM>
nHat = 13^(ceiling[log base 13 of n])
numDigits = floor[log base 13 of nHat] + 1

count[nHat] = {0,...,0}     //Array where each index corresponds to a potential digit in base 13
missing[numDigits]

for(place = 0 to numDigits)
     for (aElement = 0  to nHat-1)
          fetched = fetch(aElement, place)     // Returns a value between 0 and nHat-1
          count[fetched] += 1     // tally number of each digit found
     kk = 0
     for (ii = 0 to 12)
          if count[ii] < nHat/13     // nHat/13 is the expected number of each digit
               missingNum[kk] = ii     // Store digit in an array, where the missing number is built digit by digit
     reset all indices of count to 0

// Converts elements of array back into the number they represent
for hh = 0 to numDigits
     number  += missingNum[hh]*13^hh

return number
</VERBATIM>

---+++ Anaylsis
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm is Theta(nlogn). The outermost loop runs logn times. nHat is 13^logbase_13 of n = n, so 
numDigits is logbase_13 n. Then the first inner loop runs nHat times, which we just determined is basically
n. The second for loop runs a constant amount of times. So in total the nested for loop structure takes nlogn.
The second main-level for loop runs n times, but nlogn is still the dominant term.

            }
            *data[kk] = temp;   // Either put the temp value back where you got it from, or complete the swap
        }
    }
