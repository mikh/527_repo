---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>
ii. Secondary Clustering

The hashing functions are not linearly probing. Therefore, the collisions that occur in the table will be spaced out as opposed to many consecutive filled slots in the table.

iii. Always able to add a key if the table is not full

Yes, keys can be added to the table as long as it is not full. However, the size of the table is optimal when it is equal to <latex> \frac{n*\ln(p)}{\ln(2)^2} </latex>. Where n is the number of items you're planning on putting through the filter and p is the probability you're willing to accept false positives.

<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

Make a new array, <latex> X_2</latex>, that is the result of merge sorting the two arrays <latex> X_0 </latex>  and   <latex>X_1 \newline</latex> 
The median is equal to (n*2)/2 (where n is the size of the given arrays), considering <latex> X_2 </latex> will always have an even number of elements.

<latex> \Theta(nlog(n)) </latex>

---+++ ii. Median of three

---++++ Algorithm

Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

Make a new array, <latex> X_3</latex>, that is the result of merge sorting <latex>X_0 </latex> and <latex> X_1 \newline</latex>  
Make another array, <latex> X_4</latex>, that is the result of merge sorting <latex>X_2 </latex> and <latex> X_3 \newline</latex> 
The median is then equal to <latex> \frac{(n*3)}{2} </latex> if even. Where n is the size of the given arrays.
The median is then equal to <latex> \frac{((n*3) + 1)}{2} </latex> if odd

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
Give out the explanation here. Remember attached the code and table
</VERBATIM>

The code begins by creating the string "!!!". The string then enters a nested for loop where each ASCII character's decimal value is incremented by a number between 0 and 9 creating a new string. Each new string is stored in the startStr array as a password (key). Afterwards the string is hashed, reduced, hashed, and reduced once more and is stored in the endStr as a value. The code ends with an output stream that creates a rainbowtable within a "rainbowtable.txt" file through the use of a for loop with the format: (password, value).
