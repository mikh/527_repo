---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
ii (secondary clustering)


Hi(k)=H(i-1)(k)+i
so
eventually we will have something like
Hn(k)=H0(k)+(sum_of_"i"s from 0 to n)

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>

Let the medians be a and b. Then the median of the two arrays will be in between a and b. So in X0 we can throw all the elements which are less than a. In X1 we can throw all the elements that are bigger than b.
a_low,b_low, a_high,b_high-array [edge  indexes]

int FindMedian (int X0[],int a_low,int a_high, int X[], int b_low, int b_high){
a_mid=a_low+(a_low+a_high)/2;
a_med=X0[a_mid];
b_mid=b_low+(b_low+b_high)/2;
b_med=X[b_mid];
if (a_high-a_low+b_high-b_low<4) then 
           find the median of elements in a constant time;
else if (a_med<b_med)
           FindMedian (X0[], a_mid,a_high,b_low,b_high,b_mid+1)
else
           FindMedian (X[],a_mid+1,a_high,b_low,b_high,b_mid)


}


</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
T(n)=T(n/2)+O(1)=>
complexity=O(log(n)) 

</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
say we have three arrays a,b,c.  We can use the same method as in part i.
Let's take their medians to be a_med,b_med, c_med
so the final median will be in between the smallest and the largest medians

int FindMedian (int a[],int b[],int c[]){
a_med=median(a);
b_med=median(b);
c_med=median(c);

smallest=min(a_med,b_med,c_med);
largest=max(a_med,b_med,c_med);

lets assume that a_med=min, and b_med=max, then (procedure) {
throw away elements that are less than a_med from a[] and assign j=number of elements that are less than or equal to a_med;
throw away j elements from the end of b[]
}

iterate this procedure until we are left with two arrays. now we can use method from part i.



}
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
finding min,max=Theta(3)
Theta(log(n)) from part i

so overall, running time should be Theta(log(n))
</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
We can use the same strategy as in part ii by trying to reduce the problem to two arrays.
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
finding the smallest/largest median will take Theta(n) time
so overall,
running time is Theta(n+log(n)) which is basically Theta (n)

unsigned int FNV_INIT = 2166136261;

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
so the hash algorithm i used here is called FNV(Fowler–Noll–Vo) hash function
which is basically this
hash = offset_basis
for each octet_of_data to be hashed
        hash = hash * FNV_prime
        hash = hash xor octet_of_data
return hash 
//source: http://isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/
It also is very convenient since I can get another hash function just by changing the order of multiplying and XORing bits
FNV_prime was chosen from the list of magic numbers-so produced hash functions are better distributed throughout m-sized hash table
So then I multiply hval by the magic number that is represented as a sum of powers of two and then i left shift it by those powers

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
I'm 
1) generating random ASCII characters (33-127) then concatinating them into strings of random size
2) then reducing them to size 5, storing them in the first column of my table (password)
3) then hashing it, reducing it and etc 100 times. the result is stored in the second column 
that's basically it

P.s:I hope that hashing them 100 times is enough
