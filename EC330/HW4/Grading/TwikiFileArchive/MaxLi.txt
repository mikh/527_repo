ii. Secondary clustering. 

h1(k) = h1(k) + 1
h2(k) = h2(k) + 3
h3(k) = h3(k) + 6
h4(k) = h4(k) + 10
It is secondary clustering because the function requires the function with the index before it, and if you sub it in, it becomes clear that it is a summation, which is a quadratic equation. Because it is quadratic, that means there is secondary clustering.

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
for X0
    find median
for X1
    find median

if X0[median] < X1[median]
    delete smaller elements to median of X0 
    delete bigger elements to median of X1
    recursively call on new smaller array

if X0[median] > X1[median]
    delete bigger elements to median of X0
    delete smaller elements to median of X1
    recursively call on new smaller array

if X0[median] == X1[median]
    return median


Find median of both arrays. For the smaller median, delete every element smaller than that inside the array. For the bigger median, delete every element bigger than that median in that array. Recursively do this until there is only one value left, which is the median. Or, if there are two values, then add it both up and divide by 2 to get the median.

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Find median of all three arrays. For the smallest median, delete every element smaller than that inside that array. For the biggest array, delete every element bigger than that median in that array. Recursively do this until there is only one value left, which is the median. Or if there are two values, then add both up and divide by 2 to get the median. This is similar to the two arrays, except with three arrays, you need to keep track of what median is the biggest and what median is the smallest.

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
The same concept can be applied to n arrays. With n arrays, we would need to find the minimum median and the maximum median, so we know which arrays to cut off in order to reduce the amount of elements in the array. Then, we recursively call this method until there is only one value left, or if there are two values, add them up and divide by 2.

			acc ++;
		} else {
			acc += 10;
		}

		count++;
	}

	return *bloomArr;
}

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
I made myBloomFilter an extended class of BloomFilter. It instantiates a myBloomFilter that is length long, and the insert function and the exists function utilizes local accumulator variables for the hash function, which I incremenet by different amounts to test false positives.

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
I made my rainbow table about 5000 long, because it is like the rainbow table we are given. I used 88 characters, so I came up with random integers to 88. Then I hashed and reduced the string multiple times, and finally, I did the formatting for the rainbow table.
