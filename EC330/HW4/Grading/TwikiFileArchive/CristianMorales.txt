---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
Because the probe sequence effectively relies on recursion, it can be shown through iteration that for any given i, hi(k) = h0(k) + (i(i+1))/2. Because of this, since each i is different, the term (i(i+1))/2 will also always be different, ensuring that hi(k) is always different. This means that the third property is true and the probe sequence will always be able to add a key if the table is not full.

int X[2*n];                                           // Create a master array that will hold the contents of X0 and X1
for(int ii = 0; ii < n; ii = ii+2){
    X[ii] = X0[ii];                                    // Build the array so that X[0] = X0[0], X[1] = X1[0], X[2] = X0[1], X[3] = X1[1], ...
    X[ii+1] = X1[ii];
}
BubbleSort(X);                                   // Sort the master array. As it's initially nearly sorted, the time should be O(n)
return X[n];                                     // Once the master array is sorted, determine the median by getting the value at the center of the master array (.5(2*n) = n)

This algorithm simply creates a master array that has the values of the two initial arrays. This master array
is created by making  X[0] = X0[0], X[1] = X1[0], X[2] = X0[1], X[3] = X1[1], X[4] = X1[2], X[5] = X1[2], and so
on so that when it is finished being created, the master array is already nearly sorted. Creating this array takes
time O(2n) since it requires a for loop that increments n times and performs 2 actions each time.

Next, we take advantage of the master array's partial sorted-ness. Sorting the master array using BubbleSort,
we will have a runtime O(n). After this, all that needs to be done is determine the median by finding the value at
the center of the master array.

Thus the total runtime is O(n).

int X[3*n];                                           // Create a master array that will hold the contents of X0 and X1
for(int ii = 0; ii < n; ii = ii+3){
    X[ii] = X0[ii];                                    // Build the array so that X[0] = X0[0], X[1] = X1[0], X[2] = X2[0], X[3] = X0[1], X[4] = X1[1], X[5] = X2[1], ...
    X[ii+1] = X1[ii];
    X[ii+2] = X2[ii]
}
BubbleSort(X);                                   // Sort the master array. As it's initially nearly sorted, the time should be O(n)
return X[1.5*n];                                     // Once the master array is sorted, determine the median by getting the value at the center of the master array (.5(3*n) = 1.5*n)

This algorithm simply creates a master array X that has the values of the two initial arrays. This master array
is created by making  X[0] = X0[0], X[1] = X1[0], X[2] = X2[0], X[3] = X0[1], X[4] = X1[1], X[5] = X2[1], and so
on so that when it is finished being created, the master array is already nearly sorted. Creating this array takes
time O(3n) since it requires a for loop that increments n times and performs 3 actions each time.

Next, we take advantage of the master array's partial sorted-ness. Sorting the master array using BubbleSort,
we will have a runtime O(n). After this, all that needs to be done is determine the median by finding the value at
the center of the master array, in this case X[1.5*n] (0.5*(3*n) = 1.5*n)

Thus the total runtime is O(n).

int X[n*n];                                           // Create a master array that will hold the contents of X0, X1, X2, ..., Xn
for(int ii = 0; ii < n; ii = ii+(n-1)){
    X[ii] = X0[ii];                                    
    X[ii+1] = X1[ii];
    X[ii+2] = X2[ii];
    ...
    X[ii+(n-1)] = X(n-1)[ii];
}
BubbleSort(X);                                   // Sort the master array. As it's initially nearly sorted, the time should be O(n)
return X[0.5*n*n];                               // Once the master array is sorted, determine the median by getting the value at the center of the master array (.5(n*n) = 5*(n^2))
