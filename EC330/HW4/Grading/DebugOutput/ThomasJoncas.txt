---++ Problem 1 - Hashing

First, let's look at h_i(k) for different values of i: <BR><BR> Given: h_0(k) = h(k)<BR>h_1(k) = h_0(k) + 1 = h(k) + 1<BR>h_2(k) = h_1(k) + 2 = h(k) + 3<BR> h_3(k) = h(k) + 6<BR>h_4(k) = h(k) + 10<BR>h_5(k) = h(k) + 15
<BR><BR> So for i >= 1 we have h_i(k) = h(k) + i(i+1)/2 <BR><BR>The i(i+1)/2 part forms a triangular number for each i>=1.

<BR><BR> i) Primary clustering:  No because say h(a) = 1, h(b) = 2, h(c) = 3.  We have h_1(a) = 2 = h(b) but then the sequence for a and b don't collide again.  We also have h_1(b) = 3 = h(c) but then the sequence for b and c does not collide again.  So that means that just because a sequence collides, it doesn't necessarily continue colliding (unless the original hash function hashes to the same thing [see secondary clustering below]).<BR><BR>

ii) Secondary clustering: Yes, because if any two things hash to the same original value, they will follow the same sequence (ie only the original value of the hash determines the course of the sequence taken).  Say h(foo) = h(bar).  Then we know that h_i(foo) = h_i(bar) for all i because of the probe sequence.  Thus, we will observe secondary clustering.<BR><BR>

iii) Always able to add a key if table is not full: No.  Let's take a small example to prove why:<BR>Let's say the address space goes from 0 to 9 for convenience sake.  Let h(a) = 1, h(alpha) = 1, h(b) = 2, h(c) = 4, h(d) = 7, h(e) = 3, h(f) = 6, h(g) = 8, h(x) = 9, h(y) = 0.  Let's say we first hash alpha, then b, then, c, then d, e, f, g, x, and y.  So our table has addresses 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 filled from all the letters except a.  Now let's try to hash a.  h(a) = 1 but 1 is already taken so let's try h_1(a) = 2, but 2 is already taken.  Now moving to h_2(a) = 4, we see that's taken and h_3(a) = 7 is also taken.  We then move to h_4(a) = 11, but that goes beyond our address space so we have to mod 11 by 10 and we have 11%10 = 1 which is already taken.  If we keep looking through the sequence (1+i(i+1)/2)%10, we never get 5 as a result.  Thus, we cannot hash a into the table, yet the table is not yet full (address 5 is empty).  Thus we are NOT always able to add a key to the table even if it is not full. <BR><BR>

---++++ Analysis and running time

The strategy is to first look at the median of the first array and find its index (call this i), then look at which index in the second array (call this j) would imply that the median of the first array and this index in the second array are the middle elements.  But if this isn't the case, we look if X0[i] to see if its larger than both the jth and j+1th element of X1, in which case we perform a binary search in the left half of X0 for the median.  If it's the case that X0[i] is smaller than both X1[j] and X1[j+1] then we search in the right half of X0 for the median of both.  If we run out of elements in X0 to do this with before finding a middle element, we switch to doing binary searches in X1.<BR><BR>This runs in worst-case Theta(log(n)) time because the binary search for the median is done in Log(n) time and it takes constant time to find the medians of each array and compare it to an element in the other array.

---++++ Analysis and running time

For the efficient algorithm, I find the median of all of the arrays in constant time.  Then I look at the smallest median, and from the array that contains it, I remove all elements less than that median.  Then I look at the largest median and from the array that contains it, I remove all elements larger than that median.  I do this recursively until there are only 1 or 2 elements left overall, at which point I have my median as either the last remaining element or the average of the last 2 elements.<BR><BR>

The running time of this efficient algorithms is Theta(log(n)) because within the while loop, we only have constant time operations because it takes constant time to find the median of a sorted array and it also takes constant time to remove elements from the array.  The while loop is executed a maximum of Theta(log(n)) times because the arrays are n elements long and we are deleting at half of at least one of the arrays each time it runs.  Thus the overall algorithm is Theta(log(n)).<BR><BR>


For comparison, here is an analysis of the merge method:<BR> What's going on for the merge method is I have an index for each of the 3 arrays and keep taking the smallest element out of what's pointed to by the 3 indexes each time and put it in the running-count index of the merged array.  I keep doing this until I fill up to index 3*length/2 because 3*length/2 is the position of the median of the merged array.  If the length was even, the median is the average of the 3*length/2th element and the 3*length/2-1th element, otherwise, the median is just the 3*length/2th element.<BR><BR>The running time here is Theta(n) where n is the length of each array because the only loop is the while loop which goes from 0 up to 3n/2 doing constant time operations; everything else here is constant time if we use the appropriate data structures it will be constant time to compare the values of elements and to access the elements.

---++++ Analysis and running time
The basic algorithm is to keep taking the medians of all of the arrays and deleting all elements smaller than the median of the array with the smallest median from that array and all elements larger than the median of the array with the largest median from that array recursively until there are only 1 or 2 elements left.  At this point, you can just return the median from these.<BR><BR>

Each operation such as finding a median of a sorted array or throwing away elements from the start or end of an array is constant time.  Thus, each iteration through the while loop is constant time.  Since each iteration removes half of the elements from at least one array, the loop can be executed a maximum of log(n) times.  Thus the running time overall is Theta(log(n)).<BR><BR>


Below is the running time for the brute force merge method for comparison:<BR><BR>
Here, I have an array of  n arrays each with length n.  I make another array of length n that keeps an index on each of the arrays so that I can merge them.  Most of the code is actually just to figure out the next smallest element out of what's left and put it into the merged array.  I keep putting elements into merged array and incrementing indexes until I reach the point where I've gotten to the median of all of the arrays.  Then, I take care of the case for even or odd length of n*n because this is the number of total numbers we have and are looking for the median of.<BR><BR>

The running time here is a bit more complicated.  Finding the max of the array takes Theta(n) because we only have to look at the last element of each array since they are sorted.  Then we have a while loop that takes place from 0 to n*n/2.  Within this loop we have another loop that goes from 0 to n-1.  So we have n^2 * n = n^3 and the entire algorithm is Theta(n^3).

---+++ Explanation

For a Bloom Filter, we know that the best number of hashes to use is k = (m/n)ln(2) where m is the length of the bloom filter and n is the number of things that have been put through the filter.  I tried it with two hashes with fairly good results and a relatively high score.  I did not have enough time to implement it in a more complicated way that kept track of how many things had gone through the filter and used this to decide how many hashes to use for a given input.  If we were given how many items would be put through the filter, I would have used the above formula to determine how many hashes to use.  <BR><BR>

I used an array of chars to keep track of the contents of the bloom filter.  I set the respective character (index of the char array based on the hash value mod length of filter) to '1' when inserting something to the filter.  Then, to check if something was probably in the filter, I checked to make sure that both of the values that the input would hash to were set to '1' in the filter to say that it was probably sent through the filter.  Both hashes I used came from the web and are cited in the comments in the .cpp file.

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*

For my rainbow table, I assumed that passwords would be of length 3 (this was one of my simplifications).  I went through and hashed a bunch of 3 character strings and then reduced after 1 hash and this became my lefthand column.  Then, I ran 50 more hash/reduce cycles on each of these to make the righthand column.  These strings were stored in vectors and then I used fstream to output them to a text file which is attached.  Obviously this method could be extended to longer passwords, but I kept it simple as the problem stated.
