---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
%CODE{"cpp"}%
if there is only one number in each array x0 and x1
     return the two numbers added up then divided by two
else 
     find the median value of both arrays
     if the median value in x0 is greater than x1
          return the recursive call on the lesser half of x0 and the greater half of x1
     else 
          return the recursive call on the greater half of x0 and the lesser half of x1

%ENDCODE%

---++++ Analysis and running time

The median value of two arrays of length n will always result in an even number of numbers so the median will be the average of two numbers. This is similar to a binary search. The size of the problem is cut in half each recursive call of the array. So the runtime is <latex> \Theta (logn) </latex>


---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
%CODE{"cpp"}%
for each value in each array
use merge to merge the three arrays into an array of size 3n
if 3n is even
the median is (x3[3n/2]+x3[(3n/2)+1])/2
else
the median is x3[floor(3n/2)]
%ENDCODE%

---++++ Analysis and running time

Since there is merging of each array and every element is touched. The runtime will be 3n which is <latex> \Theta(n) </latex>. 


---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
%CODE{"cpp"}%
for each value in each array
use merge to merge the three arrays into an array of size 3n
if 3n is even
the median is (xn[n*n/2]+xn[(n*n/2)+1])/2
else
the median is xn[floor(n*n/2)]
%ENDCODE%

---++++ Analysis and running time
This is similar to a group of 3 arrays. Every element will be merged into an array of size <latex> n^{2} </latex> and the takes the runtime <latex> \Theta(n^{2}) </latex>

---++ Problem 3 - Bloom filters *[25 points]*
---+++ Code
%CODE{"cpp"}%

#include <string>
#include "myBloomFilter.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// constructor given the length of the filter
myBloomFilter::myBloomFilter(int mm) {
	filter = "";					
	length = mm;
	for (int i = 0; i < mm; i++) {		// fill every character in the filter as '0' to signify that it is empty
		filter += '0';
	}
}

// constructor given a filter
myBloomFilter::myBloomFilter(string filter) {
	length = filter.length();
	this->filter = filter;
}

// first hash function
int hash1(string item, int length) {
	int a = 37;							// two prime numbers
	int b = 509573;
	unsigned int hash = 0;				// the hash value

	for (int i = 0; i < item.length(); i++) {		// loop through every character in the item
		hash = ((hash * a * item[i]) ^ b) % length;	// perform a hash on each character
	}
	return hash;						// return the hash
}

// second hash function
int hash2(string item, int length) {
	int a = 101;						// two prime numbers
	int b = 103553;
	unsigned int hash = 0;				// the hash

	for (int i = 0; i < item.length(); i++) {		// loop through every character in the item
		hash = ((hash * a * item[i]) ^ b) % length;	// perform a hash on each character
	}
	return hash;						// return the hash
}

// third hash function
int hash3(string item, int length) {
	int a = 151;						// two prime numbers
	int b = 932447;
	unsigned int hash = 0;				// the hash

	for (int i = 0; i < item.length(); i++) {		// loop through every character in the item
		hash = ((hash * a * item[i]) ^ b) % length;	// perform a hash on each character
	}	
	return hash;						// return the hash
}


void myBloomFilter::insert(string item) {
	int hashNum1 = hash1(item,length);		// call all of the hash functions on the item
	int hashNum2 = hash2(item,length);
	int hashNum3 = hash3(item,length);
	filter[hashNum1] = '1';					// add it to the correct index of the filter based on what the hash returns
	filter[hashNum2] = '1';
	filter[hashNum3] = '1';
}

bool myBloomFilter::exists(string item) {	
	int hashNum1 = hash1(item,length);		// calls all of the hash functions on the item in questions
	int hashNum2 = hash2(item,length);
	int hashNum3 = hash3(item,length);
	if (filter[hashNum1] == '1' && filter[hashNum2] == '1' && filter[hashNum3] == '1') {	// if all three indeces are '1' then it is likely that the item exists
		return true;
	} 
	return false;							// if one of the indeces has a '0' then it doesn't exist
}

string myBloomFilter::output() {			// returns the bloom filter for output
	return filter;
}





%ENDCODE%

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
I determined that three hash functions were sufficient to get a decent probability of no false positives. The hash functions do several things to each character of the item like xor the bits and multiply by a prime. I used a string and string operators as the bloom filter.

---+++ 4b. Simplified rainbow tables
<VERBATIM>
I have attached the code I used to attempt to get the passwords. It has been running for 2+hrs now without any success. 
</VERBATIM>

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
I created a table with 1000 entries and the number of hashes/reduces between the first column and the second column is 10,000. The code is attached with comments on my code. I used random passwords to start.
