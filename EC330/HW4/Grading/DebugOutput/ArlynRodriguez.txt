---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
    Combine into one array
    Merge Sort until you reach the (n/2)th element
    Add the [(n/2)-1]th element and the (n/2)th element, then divide this by 2- this gives you the median
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Runtime: O(n)  (worst case merge sort and combining 2n elements)
</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Find the median for each array
    Find the min and max median
    Eliminate all elements in the array containing the min median that are below that min
    Eliminate all elements in the array containing the max median that are above that max
    Merge Sort as described above in (i)
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Runtime: O(n)  (worst case merge sort and combining 2n elements, since n of them are eliminated in this process)
</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Separate into groups of three	 
For each group of three:
      -Find the median for each array
      -Find the min and max median
      - Eliminate all elements in the array containing the min median that are below that min
      - Eliminate all elements in the array containing the max median that are above that max
Continue the process and continue grouping into groups of three until we only have one group remaining
Merge Sort as described above in (i)
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
