---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
i. NO primary clustering. Because the values of h_i(k) are not increasing by any linear amount, there is no primary clustering.
As i gets large, the value of h_i(k) is much greater than that of h_(i-1)(k) thus the two locations are spread far apart and we have
no primary clustering. Also, the interval i between two adjacent locations changes, so if two probe sequences overlap in the same
location but not at the same value of i then they will diverge again.

ii. YES secondary clustering. If two probe sequences have the same h_0(k) then the two sequences will be the same for all values
of i (i.e. identical sequences). This is the definition of secondary clustering given in the textbook!

iii. NOT always able to add to a non-full table. Consider the simple example where the hash table is an array of length 10, and h_0 = 0.
Then h_0 = 0, h_1 = 1, h_2 = 3, h_3 = 6, h_4 = 0, h_5 = 5, h_6 = 1, h_7 = 8, h_8 = 6, h_9 = 5, h_10 = 5.
After, h_11 = 6, h_12 = 8, h_13 = 1, h_14 = 5, h_15 = 0, h_16 = 1, h_17 = 8, h_18 = 6, h_19 = 5, h_20 = 5;
We see that this pattern of {6,8,1,5,0,1,8,6,5,5} will repeat every ten number in the future, because when we add 10 but mod by 10
it doesn't change the value of the hash function. Therefore it does not hit every element (notice 2,4,7,9 never hit)

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
From http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

find_median(a,b,n) // a and b are sorted arrays, n = size of each array
    med_a = median of a; // n/2 element of a
    med_b = median of b; // n/2 element of b
    if a == b, return a; // Same median means we are done
    if n == 2, return (max(a[0], b[0]) + min(a[1], b[1])) / 2; // Formula for median of two sorted arrays of length two
    else if a > b, call find_median(a[0...|_n/2_|], b[|_n/2_|...n-1], n/2); // Recursively find median
    else if a < b, call find_median(a[|_n/2_|...n-1], b[0...|_n/2_|], n/2);
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Here, finding med_a and med_b takes constant time since the arrays are already sorted. The base case, when n == 2, also takes constant time. 
Comparing a and b takes constant time as well, so we have a recursion where:
T(n) = T(n/2) + theta(1)
We can solve this with a recursion tree, where we expand T(n/2) and then T(n/4) and we end up adding log(n) terms of theta(1), which
means that our runtime is:
Theta(log(n)).
</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
find_median(a,b,c, n) // a, b, c are sorted arrays, n = length of each array
    initialize three pointers, one to beginning of each array
    initialize a counter to 0;
    compare the element pointed to by each pointer, take smallest
        and advance that pointer, also incrementing count
    when count reaches 3n/2, return that element
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Initializing variables takes constant time. Comparing three elements takes constant time.
We compare three elements 3n/2 times, so the overall complexity is Theta(1) * Theta(n), or:
Theta(n)
</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
find_median(a1,a1....an, n) // a1, a2...an are sorted arrays, n = length of each array
    initialize n pointers, one to beginning of each array
    initialize a counter to 0;
    compare the element pointed to by each pointer, take smallest
        and advance that pointer, also incrementing count
    when count reaches (n^2)/2, return that element
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Initializing n pointers takes order n time. Comparing n elements takes (n-1) time. We compare n elements
(n^2)/2 times, so the overall complexity is n * (n^2)/2, or complexity is:
Theta(n^3)

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
I designed my bloom filter to work with a (simplified?) CRC32 hash. The hash takes a string in as an input, then treats the string
as a monic polynomial, where each of the coefficients is either one or zero, depending on the corresponding bit in the string. Thus, each character
in the string is treated as eight separate bits. The algorithm, which I got a rough outline for from Knuth, divides the input polynomial by the CRC32
polynomial, which is easily found on the web. It then returns the remainder after that division, which is used as an index into the bloom filter. The 
bloom filter itself is an array of chars, initialized to zero on the creation of an empty bloom filter. The insert function takes a string, computes its 
CRC32 hash, then takes that hash and indexes the array by that hash, turning that char to 1. Exists does the same thing - it looks at the hash of the
string being tested, sees if that entry in the char array is 0, and if it is then the function returns false. Otherwise it returns true, because we have no
way to tell for sure whether or not it is actually in there. I run each input through two CRC32 hashes for a better bloom filter. The hashes are distinct
because in the CRC32 hash function I append the hash number along with three 'x' chars to the string, thus creating potentially infinite hashes from
that single function. I chose to do two hashes because that was all I could run on the upload page in the given amount of time - anything more timed
out.

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
I created a very general program that could generate a rainbow table. There are three definitions at the beginning of the file, which
allow the user to specify how long they want the strings in the rainbow table, how many hash/reduces they want between pairs in
the rainbow table, and how many rows of the rainbow table they want. For generality, I ran the code with STR_LENGTH = 5, 
NUM_HASHES = 1000 and TABLE_LENGTH = 10000. The code works by creating a string of 'x's with length equal to STR_LENGTH,
then hashing and reducing that starting string NUM_HASHES times. At the end, the last string is used as the pair to the starting string
and creates the first entry in the rainbow table. Then, I hash and reduce the last string one more time and that result becomes the
starting string for the next row of the table. I hash/reduce again as described above, and repeat this process TABLE_LENGTH times.
Each time I get a pair, I write it into an output file in the format start,stop\n.
