---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
first find the median of the two arrays. next you may eliminate any numbers below the smallest 
median and any numbers larger than the biggest median may also be eliminated. then 
continue finding medians of the arrays and deleting with respect to the median as was 
aforementioned. In the end there will either be one number which is your median or 
the median will be 1 apart in with your median will be in the middle of those two 
values.so just simply keep checking is all the medians are the same value or if it
 is solely 2 values in which you'd cut it in half
</VERBATIM>
---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
worst case <latex> \theta (logn) </latex>
</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
first find the median of the three arrays. next you may eliminate any numbers below the smallest 
median and any numbers larger than the biggest median may also be eliminated. then 
continue finding medians of the arrays and deleting with respect to the median as was 
aforementioned. In the end there will either be one number which is your median or 
the median will be 1 apart in with your median will be in the middle of those two 
values.so just simply keep checking is all the medians are the same value or if it
 is solely 2 values in which you'd cut it in half
</VERBATIM>

</VERBATIM>
---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
first find the median of each array. next you may eliminate any numbers below the smallest 
median and any numbers larger than the biggest median may also be eliminated. then 
continue finding medians of the arrays and deleting with respect to the median as was 
aforementioned. In the end there will either be one number which is your median or 
the median will be 1 apart in with your median will be in the middle of those two 
values.so just simply keep checking is all the medians are the same value or if it
 is solely 2 values in which you'd cut it in half
