---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
The sequence given is recognized to be a linear probe sequence. Which means that as the function maps out to a space on the map, if occupied it will move on to the next one. It exhibits TWO of the three properties mentions: Primary Clustering, and always able to add a key if the table is not full. Primary Clustering would be a property because if the space or key is already occupied then the equation adds an i value which would result in moving to the next available term. Keys that map onto the same position would end up occupying the following adjacent spaces and would result in nearby clustering. This would also show how the table will always add a key if not full since any full space would push the key to the next one available, even if it's at the end it would push it to the start of the map. Only until the table is full then will a key have no place to be mapped! The function does not show secondary clustering because it's a linear equation and not a quadratic equation with i^2 where clustering would occur at further and further intervals to the original map position.

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
first you compare the 2 medians. If the median for X_0 is greater than X_1 we know that the answer will be somewhere in the lower half of X_0 or the upper half of X_1. We can recursively keep calculating the medians of the two arrays until each array only has 2 elements left. You can then take the maximum of the first elements of both arrays, add it to the minimum of the second element of both arrays and divide by 2 to get the median.

---++++ Analysis and running time
since we are dividing both arrays each time, the running time for this algorithm will be bounded by log(n).

<latex> \Theta (logn) </latex>
---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
I know that for the three arrays that the median must be between the biggest and smallest median. We then can eliminate anything less than or equal to the the lower median in its array, and anything higher than the upper median in its array. However, this time we need to make sure that we are only deleting the same number of elements from each array. Therefore we will remove the smaller amount of the two from each array. Once you get down to 2 arrays, you no longer remove anything that is equal to the median, and then you continue until 1 element remains (your median) or 2 elements remain (average them for your median).

---++++ Analysis and running time
Since this algorithm will be run as many times as we can divide the three arrays, removing constants it will just be bounded by log(n)

<latex> \Theta(log(n)) </latex>
---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
This will be the exact same algorithm as before. We will continue to remove the minimum amount that is greater than the maximum median in the maximum array and the minimum median in the minimum array. We will continue to do this until there are only 2 arrays left, where you no longer throw out the medians. Then continue until only 1 or 2 elements remain. If 2 elements are left just average them for your median. 
---++++ Analysis and running time
since we will have to divide each array log(n) times and there are n arrays, the running time will be bounded by n*log(n).

<latex>\Theta(n*log(n))</latex>

---+++ Explanation
For this problem we had a couple challenges to solve. The first was to design good hash functions that would map a key in different places. We thought the simpler the hash functions the better. Another factor we considered was the optimal number number of hash functions to produce a low false positive rate. Using the the optimal equation learned in class k=m/n *.6 estimating an m and n we decided that 4 hashes would be a good number (as well as testing it experimentally). The hashes were all moded to the length of the bloom filter so we'd always index a value in. 

The hashes were a simple sum, a simple product, a summation of a running sum and running product of the numbers, and finally each char to the power of it's significant digit. Since the char's are actual numbers this sum and product could be easily calculated. As a final step we multiplied each hash by a different prime number so they would all differ to a high probability and then mod with absolute value.

Insert uses always all the hash functions to put the information in and exist would check if a member was in by hashing and peeking at the Bloom Filter. The print out was done simply with a string stream.

In terms of solving the challenges the hash functions used different strategies and coupled with the different prime numbers almost always yielded a different value (so that no two hashes of the same string were the same). Finding the ideal number of hashes was done both thoeretically and experimentally to lower the probability of a false positive after a certain length threshold is passed. And Finally the last challenge: converting to char was easy since the multiplication or the sum would convert it to an integer that was easy to deal with and bloom filter it.

I generated my rainbow table by slightly modifying the provided reduce function, and hashing and reducing 10,000 randomly generated 5 character strings. The rainbow table consists of the starting string, as well as the ending string after the hash/reduce cycle was completed
