---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
This probe sequence is linearand will therefore exhibit primaryclustering. The only time it would not update the table if it was not already full is if there was a collision, which means it could always add a key.

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.

merge arrays via insertion
stop on element n
element n is median

</VERBATIM>
---++++ Analysis and running time
The median is the middle value, which means it will be the middle value of the new array, and since the arrays are sorted it is possible to merge them in order with insertion. The new array has 2n elements, so the middle value is n.

Theta(n)
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
merge arrays via insertion
stop on element (3/2)n
element (3/2)n is median
</VERBATIM>
This uses the same methodology as above. Merging the three arrays takes constant time, and then the median element is the (3/2)n element because there are 3n elements in the new array.

Theta(n)
---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
merge arrays via insertion
stop on element (n/2)n
element (n/2)n is median
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
This is once again the same as above. Merge n arrays, each with n elements for a new array with n^2 elements. The new array will have a median at n^2/2.

Theta(n^2)
</VERBATIM>

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
I used two hashes that I found online (http://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/algorithms/jsw_tut_hashing.aspx). The two I used were the Rotating Hash, and the Modified Berstein Hash. These were used to turn the strings into integer numbers that would be well distributed and then I used a multiplication hash with A equal to (sqrt(5)-1)/2 to modify the hash so that it was within the bounds of my problem.
