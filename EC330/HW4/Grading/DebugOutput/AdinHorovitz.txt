---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>

This hash will display secondary clustering only.

The slot found for any key on its Ith collision will be stored in slot:

h_i(k) = h(k) + i(i+1)/2

This is a quadratic probe sequence, therefore it will display secondary clustering.


ii: Primary clustering will only be seen in linear probe sequences. 
iii: This probe sequence will fail to fill a map with an odd number of slots. 

--> Assuming there is a modulus implied in the probe sequence, the slots identified after enough clusters will 
address the same limited slots infinitely

--> If we don't assume an implied modulus, there is nothing in this probe structure as it's written to indicate
that a slot with an address greater than the size of the map will address slots that are out of bounds.

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>

Merge sorted arrays (a la merge sort)

Median value is in the middle index



</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>

The merge step runs in O(n log n)

Indexing the median is in constant time...


Overall run time = O(n log n)


</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>

Merge first two arrays a la merge sort.

Merge third array into array.

Once all are merged, median is in middle index.


</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>

Merge will run in O(2n log n) 

Therefore, this will not have a different asymptotic bound.

O(nlogn)



</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n


Continue merging all arrays together.

Index median value.
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>

Merging each array will run in O(nlogn) time

Therefore, overall runtime = O(n^2 log n)
