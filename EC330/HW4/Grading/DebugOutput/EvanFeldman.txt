---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>
Take the median of the two sorted arrays,m if they are equal we're done, if not then we look at the array consisting of the larger half of the array containing the smaller median and the smaller half of the array containing the larger median, then repeat the process until the medians are equal or we have two unequal numbers that we average
---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

It runs through half the array each time thus the time is <latex>\theta(log(n))</latex>
---+++ ii. Median of three
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

split the third array in half, then merge the two halfs with the two other arrays, then repeat as in the last problem
---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

the rate limiting step is merging the arrays which requires going through all <latex>\frac{3 n}{2}</latex> elements thus the algorithim is <latex>O(n)</latex>
---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

we merge the arrays up to the last step where we have 2 arrays, then we perform the same technique as in part 1
---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
Give out answer here.
</VERBATIM>

merging is teh limiting step here, we have log(n) merges and each merge costs n*n time therfore the total time is <latex>\theta(n^2 log(n))</latex>

---++ Problem 4 - Password cracking

---+++ 4a.  Brute force 
<VERBATIM>
Give out the password you cracked. Remember attached the code as 'problem4a.zip'
</VERBATIM>

eom, oaf, WFS, Saw, i'd, GOK, Sui, moa, cog, EBI
---+++ 4b. Simplified rainbow tables
<VERBATIM>
Give out the password you cracked. 
</VERBATIM>

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
Give out the explanation here. Remember attached the code and table
</VERBATIM>

It generates a random string of 5 characters, hashes it then reduces it, and repeats the process 10 times, it then repeats the overall process 1000 times
