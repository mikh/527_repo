---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
The provided probe sequence resembles a quadratic probing sequence. When expanded, hi(k) = h(k) + (i^2 + i) / 2. It turns out, the hashing function is just the base hash added with the summation of the numbers 0 to i. Because this is a quadratic probing sequence, it will exhibit secondary clustering.

---++ Problem 2 - Selection 

---+++ i. Median of two
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>

//Create a new array that is twice the size of n 
int newArray[2n];
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
int k = 0;
//Create a new array that is the sorted combination of the original two 
//This is done by implementing the back half of merge sort, just using the two finger sorting method
while(i != n || j != n)
{
   if(X0[i] > X1[j])
   {
      newArray[k]  = X0[i];
      i++;
      k++;
   }
   else
   {
      newArray[k] = X1[j];
      j++;
      k++; 
   }
}
if(i == n)
{
   fill the rest of newArray[] with the remaining elements of X1;
}
else
{
   fill the rest of newArray[] with the remaining elements of X0; 
}

//Find the average of the two median terms (the size of the new array is even so we will be left with two numbers in the middle) 
medIndex = average(n/2 + (n/2 - 1));
return newArray[medIndex]; 



</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm takes 2n steps in order to iterate through the two arrays. Then, accessing the median value will  take a constant time. So overall, this algorithm would run Big O(n). 

</VERBATIM>

---+++ ii. Median of three

---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
//Say our arrays are called X0, X1, and X2
//Run the first algorithm on X0 and X1 to get newArray[], of size 2n

int finalArray[3n];
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
int k = 0;
while(i != 2n  || k != n)
{
   if(newArray[i] > X2[j])
   {
      finalArray[k] = newArray[i];
      i++;
      k++;
   }
   else
   {
      finalArray[k] = X2[j];
      j++;
      k++;
   }
}
if(i == 2n)
   fill the rest of finalArray[] with the remaining elements of X2
else
  fill the rest of finalArray[] with the remaining elements of newArray[]

if(3n%2 == 1)
   return finalArray[3n/2];
else
{
   medIndex = average(3n/2 + (3n/2 - 1));
   return finalArray[medIndex];
}


</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
The initial set up to sort array X0 and X1 takes 2n time. To create the final array takes 3n time and to select the medium index takes a constant time. So the total time it takes is 5n + 1 time which is Big O(n) time. 


</VERBATIM>

---+++ iii. Median of n
---++++ Algorithm
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm to find the medium of n arrays of size n will utilize the first algorithm an amount of times equal to n - 1 times. Similar to how the first algorithm was adopted for the second, it will be adopted for this question. The first n-1 arrays will all be combined and sorted using the first algorithm. Then the last array with this new huge array will be combined,sorted, and have its medium extracted. 
</VERBATIM>

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
If run for a large n, this algorithm will have a runtime of 

(Summation from 2 to n) * n + 1, which is equivalent to (n^3)/2 + n^2 + 1.
This run time will be Big O(n^3).

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
The BloomFilter will be a vector. Whenever a string is entered, it will be hashed by two different functions. The two hashes correspond to two indexes in the BloomFilter which will be flipped to 1 from 0. When a word is searched for in the BloomFilter, it is hashed with the same functions and tested to see if its hashes match those in the BloomFilter. If there isn't a '1' in one of the indexes which the tested word is hashed to, we know for certain it is not in the BloomFilter. If the resulting indexes from the hash functions all appear in the BloomFilter, then we know the word might be in the BloomFilter.

---+++ 4c.  Build your own simplified rainbow table *[10 points]*
<VERBATIM>
Give out the explanation here. Remember attached the code and table

In order to come up with the beginning of each chain of the rainbow table, a function to generate a random string of length 5 was used. Then, each of these random strings were run through the hash and reduce functions 15000 times to produce the last link of the rainbow table chain. 500 of these chains were created with a for loop. These strings were written into the file rainbowTableIn.txt.
