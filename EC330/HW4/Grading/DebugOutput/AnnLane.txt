---++ Problem 1 - Hashing
<VERBATIM>
ii. Secondary Clustering
In this probe sequence, these hashes can be iteratively substituted into each other. The result is a 2nd order (quadratic) arithmetic series. 
Secondary clustering occurs when the the hashes are quadratic.

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
The initial comparisons for n = 1 and n = 2 take constant time. 
Finding the median arrayA and arrayB takes constant time because I just need to access the array.
The comparison of medians is also constant time. This yields information about the range of possible medians (and decreases the size of possibilities)
Because the array is sorted, I can eliminate the half of the array that cannot possibly contain the median.
The complexity occurs due to the recurrence. Each time, the length is divided by 2 (unless a base case is reached).
The recurrence tree has a height of lg(n), so the runtime is Theta(logn)

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>
This algorithm uses the techniques of merging from merge sort to find the median. A completely sorted array is not stored because it is not necessary to find the median.
Instead, a counter keeps track of how many elements have been "sorted" and stops when half of the entire set has been sorted.
Half of the set is equal to 3 * n * (1/2), or (3/2)n. So the while loop runs (3/2)n times.
Each while loop involves exactly two comparisons, so this takes constant time.
So the runtime of this algorithm is Theta(n)

	index[N] = [1, 1, ... 1] 	//array containing N 1s
	
	//Store values for loop
	maybeMedian = 0
	minimumIndex = 0

		index[minimumIndex]++
		counter++
		
	if (length * length ) % 2		//Means the median is the average of 2 medians
		minimumIndex = findMinimumInd(currVals, length)
		upperMedian = currVals[minimumIndex]
		return (upperMedian + maybeMedian) / 2
	
	//if there are an odd number of numbers in the set
	return maybeMedian

	
findMinimumInd(arrayOfMins, length)
	currMinVal = arrayOfMins[0]
	currMinIndex = 0
	//Compare all to find minimum of array
	for ii = 1:length-2
		if arrayOfMins[ii] < currMinVal
			currMinVal = arrayOfMins
			currMinIndex = ii
	//Return the location of the minimum
	return currMinIndex
%ENDCODE%

---++++ Analysis and running time
<VERBATIM>	
This algorithm uses the merging concept from the median of three array problem.
However, the number of comparisons to find the minimum for each time through the loop is not constant. 
The function, findMinimum requires Theta(n) time.
This occurs inside a loop which runs n times.
So the overall run time is Theta(n^2)

---+++ Explanation
<VERBATIM>
My implementation includes writing the constructors, insert(), exists(), and my hash function.

insert() just computes the hash for the desired string and then replaces the character at the associated location in the filter with a '1'.

exists() also computes the hash for the desired string, gets the character at the calculated location and then determines if it is a '1' (may exist) or '0' (definitely doesn't exist)

I choose 1 hash function because, while I don't know the values of m and n in this application. 
If it is a smaller filter, one hash will have less false positives than multiple hashes. 
With a small filter and multiple hashes, the Bloom Filter can easily become nearly all 1s, which is not useful.
The hash needs to be relatively simple for efficient Bloom Filter use.
The hash iterates through the input string, multiplies it by myPrime number and by the string index and then sums the products and returns the sum. 
By multiplying by the string index, the sum is unique even if the string has the same characters. For example, abc, cba, acb, etc have different sums.
I take the mod of the resulting sum to determine the associated location in the Bloom Filter.
