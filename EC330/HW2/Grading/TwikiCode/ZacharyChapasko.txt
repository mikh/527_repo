Problem 1 [Recurrences II, 40 points]
a. T(n) = T(n-1) + n 13 .
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's third case the recurrence part is n and the f(n) part is n13, therefore this is big theta of n13

b. T(n) = 3 T(n/2) + n2.
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's third case the recurrence part is nlog23 and the f(n) part is n2, therefore this is big theta of n2

c. T(n) = 11 T(n/3) + n2.
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's first case the recurrence part is nlog311 and the f(n) part is n2, therefore this is big theta of nlog311

d. T(n) = 14 T(n/ 13) + n log n.
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's first case the recurrence part is nlog1314 and the f(n) part is n*log(n), therefore this is big theta of nlog1314

e. T(n) = 4 T(n/2) + n 2 ?n.
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's third case the recurrence part is nlog24, or n2, and the f(n) part is n2.5, therefore this is big theta of n2.5

f. T(n) = n(T(n/2) 2).
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

g. T(n) = T(n-1) + 11 lg n.
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's first case the recurrence part is n and the f(n) part is 11*lg(n), therefore this is big theta of n

h. T(n) = T(n-1) + log2(n).
Upper bound & Lower bound:

Put one answer if upper and lower bound is same. Otherwise, specify both

Explanation:

Put your explanation here

Using the master method's first case the recurrence part is n and the f(n) part is log(n)*log(n), therefore this is big theta of n

Problem 2 [Applied recurrences, 15 points]
2a.
Recurrence

Put the recurrence here

T(nn) = nn2

Running Time

Put the running time here

Explanation

Put your explanation here

The recurrence is nn2 because there is no recursive part and the actual function operates in nn2 time.
We know that the function operates in nn2 time as the sum of the terms is (nn-1) + (nn - 2) + ... + 1, which simplifies to nn2

2b.
Recurrence

Put the recurrence here

T(nn) = T(nn/13) + 1

Running Time

Put the running time here

Explanation

Put your explanation here

The recursive part of the recurrence repeats with 1/13 of the input. The f(nn) part is 1 because of the return statement. From the master method second case we know that the running time is log(nn)

2c.
Recurrence

Put the recurrence here

T(nn) = T(nn/2) + T(nn/4) + nn

Running Time

Put the running time here

Explanation

Put your explanation here

In the recursive parts of the recurrence we know that the first two terms are log2nn and log4nn. The f(nn) part is nn, though, which dominates, so the running time is f(nn)

3c. Collatz [15 points]
i. Code

// put your code here for computing CollatzCount(94770742) using a list<int> to store digits

ii. Order

Put your answer here. You may use < to denote asymptotic less-than, and = to denote asymptotic equality. 
For example, i < ii < iii

iii. Design

Put your design  here

iv. Extra credit
