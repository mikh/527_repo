See http://collaborate.bu.edu/engit/Grid/GridInstructions

Connect to eng-grid with ssh:
ssh to eng-grid.bu.edu

Update your bash environment
source /mnt/nokrb/sge/etc/bash_profile

To run interactively (for short jobs - a few seconds definitely OK)
qlogin -q interactive.q

This gives you something generic.  To find the number of cores
more /proc/cpuinfo

For more cores, me.q has up to 32 core opterons
qlogin -q me.q

bme.q has 8 core opterons
qlogin -q bme.q

Notes:
* The interactive queues also have priorities and limits, so you may
  not always get to login to the interactive queue you want.
* Once logged in to an interactive queue, there may be other users and other
  jobs running.  In particular, you might not get all of the cores for your
  job.

For long jobs, follow the instructions for submitting "batch" mode.
